C *Description
C       IL, JL, L should contain the unit  lower triangular factor of
C       the incomplete decomposition of the A matrix  stored in SLAP
C       Row format.  IU, JU, U should contain  the unit upper factor
C       of the  incomplete decomposition of  the A matrix  stored in
C       SLAP Column format This ILU factorization can be computed by
C       the SSILUS routine. The diagonals (which are all one's) are
C       stored.
C
C       =================== S L A P Column format ==================
C
C       This routine  requires that  the matrix A  be stored in  the
C       SLAP Column format.  In this format the non-zeros are stored
C       counting down columns (except for  the diagonal entry, which
C       must appear first in each  "column")  and are stored  in the
C       real array A.  In other words, for each column in the matrix
C       put the diagonal entry in A.  Then put in the other non-zero
C       elements going down   the  column (except  the diagonal)  in
C       order.  The IA array holds the row  index for each non-zero.
C       The JA array holds the offsets into the IA, A arrays for the
C       beginning of   each    column.    That  is,    IA(JA(ICOL)),
C       A(JA(ICOL)) points to the beginning of the ICOL-th column in
C       IA and  A.  IA(JA(ICOL+1)-1),  A(JA(ICOL+1)-1) points to the
C       end  of   the ICOL-th  column.  Note   that  we  always have
C       JA(N+1) = NELT+1, where  N  is the number of columns in  the
C       matrix and  NELT   is the number of non-zeros in the matrix.
C
C       Here is an example of the  SLAP Column  storage format for a
C       5x5 Matrix (in the A and IA arrays '|'  denotes the end of a
C       column):

C
C       ==================== S L A P Row format ====================
C
C       This routine requires  that the matrix A  be  stored  in the
C       SLAP  Row format.   In this format  the non-zeros are stored
C       counting across  rows (except for the diagonal  entry, which
C       must appear first in each "row") and  are stored in the real
C       array A.  In other words, for each row in the matrix put the
C       diagonal entry in  A.   Then   put  in the   other  non-zero
C       elements   going  across the  row (except   the diagonal) in
C       order.   The  JA array  holds   the column   index for  each
C       non-zero.   The IA  array holds the  offsets into  the JA, A
C       arrays  for   the   beginning  of   each  row.   That    is,
C       JA(IA(IROW)),  A(IA(IROW)) points  to  the beginning  of the
C       IROW-th row in JA and A.   JA(IA(IROW+1)-1), A(IA(IROW+1)-1)
C       points to the  end of the  IROW-th row.  Note that we always
C       have IA(N+1) =  NELT+1, where  N  is  the number of rows  in
C       the matrix  and NELT  is the  number   of  non-zeros in  the
C       matrix.
