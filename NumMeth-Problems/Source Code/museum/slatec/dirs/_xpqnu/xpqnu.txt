C***BEGIN PROLOGUE  XPQNU
C***SUBSIDIARY
C***PURPOSE  To compute the values of Legendre functions for XLEGF.
C            This subroutine calculates initial values of P or Q using
C            power series, then performs forward nu-wise recurrence to
C            obtain P(-MU,NU,X), Q(0,NU,X), or Q(1,NU,X). The nu-wise
C            recurrence is stable for P for all mu and for Q for mu=0,1.
