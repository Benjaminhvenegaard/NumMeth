C***BEGIN PROLOGUE  DFZERO
C***PURPOSE  Search for a zero of a function F(X) in a given interval
C            (B,C).  It is designed primarily for problems where F(B)
C            and F(C) have opposite signs.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     DFZERO searches for a zero of a DOUBLE PRECISION function F(X)
C     between the given DOUBLE PRECISION values B and C until the width
C     of the interval (B,C) has collapsed to within a tolerance
C     specified by the stopping criterion,
C        ABS(B-C) .LE. 2.*(RW*ABS(B)+AE).
C     The method used is an efficient combination of bisection and the
C     secant rule and is due to T. J. Dekker.
C
C     Description Of Arguments
C
C   F     :EXT   - Name of the DOUBLE PRECISION external function.  This
C                  name must be in an EXTERNAL statement in the calling
C                  program.  F must be a function of one DOUBLE
C                  PRECISION argument.
C
C   B     :INOUT - One end of the DOUBLE PRECISION interval (B,C).  The
C                  value returned for B usually is the better
C                  approximation to a zero of F.
C
C   C     :INOUT - The other end of the DOUBLE PRECISION interval (B,C)
C
C   R     :IN    - A (better) DOUBLE PRECISION guess of a zero of F
C                  which could help in speeding up convergence.  If F(B)
C                  and F(R) have opposite signs, a root will be found in
C                  the interval (B,R);  if not, but F(R) and F(C) have
C                  opposite signs, a root will be found in the interval
C                  (R,C);  otherwise, the interval (B,C) will be
C                  searched for a possible root.  When no better guess
C                  is known, it is recommended that R be set to B or C,
C                  since if R is not interior to the interval (B,C), it
C                  will be ignored.
C
C   RE    :IN    - Relative error used for RW in the stopping criterion.
C                  If the requested RE is less than machine precision,
C                  then RW is set to approximately machine precision.
C
C   AE    :IN    - Absolute error used in the stopping criterion.  If
C                  the given interval (B,C) contains the origin, then a
C                  nonzero value should be chosen for AE.
C
C   IFLAG :OUT   - A status code.  User must check IFLAG after each
C                  call.  Control returns to the user from DFZERO in all
C                  cases.
C
C                1  B is within the requested tolerance of a zero.
C                   The interval (B,C) collapsed to the requested
C                   tolerance, the function changes sign in (B,C), and
C                   F(X) decreased in magnitude as (B,C) collapsed.
C
C                2  F(B) = 0.  However, the interval (B,C) may not have
C                   collapsed to the requested tolerance.
C
C                3  B may be near a singular point of F(X).
C                   The interval (B,C) collapsed to the requested tol-
C                   erance and the function changes sign in (B,C), but
C                   F(X) increased in magnitude as (B,C) collapsed, i.e.
C                     ABS(F(B out)) .GT. MAX(ABS(F(B in)),ABS(F(C in)))
C
C                4  No change in sign of F(X) was found although the
C                   interval (B,C) collapsed to the requested tolerance.
C                   The user must examine this case and decide whether
C                   B is near a local minimum of F(X), or B is near a
C                   zero of even multiplicity, or neither of these.
C
C                5  Too many (.GT. 500) function evaluations used.
