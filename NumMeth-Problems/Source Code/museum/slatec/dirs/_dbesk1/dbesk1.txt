C***DESCRIPTION
C
C DBESK1(X) calculates the double precision modified (hyperbolic)
C Bessel function of the third kind of order one for double precision
C argument X.  The argument must be large enough that the result does
C not overflow and small enough that the result does not underflow.
C
C Series for BK1        on the interval  0.          to  4.00000E+00
C                                        with weighted error   9.16E-32
C                                         log weighted error  31.04
C                               significant figures required  30.61
C                                    decimal places required  31.64
