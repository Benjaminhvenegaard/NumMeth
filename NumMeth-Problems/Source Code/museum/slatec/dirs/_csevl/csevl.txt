C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  Evaluate the N-term Chebyshev series CS at X.  Adapted from
C  a method presented in the paper by Broucke referenced below.
C
C       Input Arguments --
C  X    value at which the series is to be evaluated.
C  CS   array of N terms of a Chebyshev series.  In evaluating
C       CS, only half the first coefficient is summed.
C  N    number of terms in array CS.
