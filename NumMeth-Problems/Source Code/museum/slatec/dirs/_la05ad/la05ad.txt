C IW(I,1),IW(I,2) HOLD THE NUMBER OF NON-ZEROS IN ROW/COL I.
C DURING THE MAIN BODY OF THIS SUBROUTINE THE VECTORS IW(.,3),IW(.,5),
C     IW(.,7) ARE USED TO HOLD DOUBLY LINKED LISTS OF ROWS THAT HAVE
C     NOT BEEN PIVOTAL AND HAVE EQUAL NUMBERS OF NON-ZEROS.
C IW(.,4),IW(.,6),IW(.,8) HOLD SIMILAR LISTS FOR THE COLUMNS.
C IW(I,3),IW(I,4) HOLD FIRST ROW/COLUMN TO HAVE I NON-ZEROS
C     OR ZERO IF THERE ARE NONE.
C IW(I,5), IW(I,6) HOLD ROW/COL NUMBER OF ROW/COL PRIOR TO ROW/COL I
