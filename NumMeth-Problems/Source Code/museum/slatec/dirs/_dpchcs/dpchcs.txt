C***SUBSIDIARY
C***PURPOSE  Adjusts derivative values for DPCHIC
C***LIBRARY   SLATEC (PCHIP)
C***TYPE      DOUBLE PRECISION (PCHCS-S, DPCHCS-D)
C***AUTHOR  Fritsch, F. N., (LLNL)
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C         DPCHCS:  DPCHIC Monotonicity Switch Derivative Setter.
C
C     Called by  DPCHIC  to adjust the values of D in the vicinity of a
C     switch in direction of monotonicity, to produce a more "visually
C     pleasing" curve than that given by  DPCHIM .

C
C  Calling sequence:
C
C        PARAMETER  (INCFD = ...)
C        INTEGER  N, IERR
C        DOUBLE PRECISION  SWITCH, H(N), SLOPE(N), D(INCFD,N)
C
C        CALL  DPCHCS (SWITCH, N, H, SLOPE, D, INCFD, IERR)
C
C   Parameters:
C
C     SWITCH -- (input) indicates the amount of control desired over
C           local excursions from data.
C
C     N -- (input) number of data points.  (assumes N.GT.2 .)
C
C     H -- (input) real*8 array of interval lengths.
C     SLOPE -- (input) real*8 array of data slopes.
C           If the data are (X(I),Y(I)), I=1(1)N, then these inputs are:
C                  H(I) =  X(I+1)-X(I),
C              SLOPE(I) = (Y(I+1)-Y(I))/H(I),  I=1(1)N-1.
C
C     D -- (input) real*8 array of derivative values at the data points,
C           as determined by DPCHCI.
C          (output) derivatives in the vicinity of switches in direction
C           of monotonicity may be adjusted to produce a more "visually
C           pleasing" curve.
C           The value corresponding to X(I) is stored in
C                D(1+(I-1)*INCFD),  I=1(1)N.
C           No other entries in D are changed.
C
C     INCFD -- (input) increment between successive values in D.
C           This argument is provided primarily for 2-D applications.
C
C     IERR -- (output) error flag.  should be zero.
C           If negative, trouble in DPCHSW.  (should never happen.)

C***REVISION HISTORY  (YYMMDD)
C   820218  DATE WRITTEN
C   820617  Redesigned to (1) fix  problem with lack of continuity
C           approaching a flat-topped peak (2) be cleaner and
C           easier to verify.
C           Eliminated subroutines PCHSA and PCHSX in the process.
C   820622  1. Limited fact to not exceed one, so computed D is a
C             convex combination of DPCHCI value and DPCHSD value.
C           2. Changed fudge from 1 to 4 (based on experiments).
C   820623  Moved PCHSD to an inline function (eliminating MSWTYP).
C   820805  Converted to SLATEC library version.
C   870707  Corrected conversion to double precision.
C   870813  Minor cosmetic changes.
C   890411  Added SAVE statements (Vers. 3.2).
C   890531  Changed all specific intrinsics to generic.  (WRB)
C   890831  Modified array declarations.  (WRB)
C   891006  Modified spacing in computation of DFLOC.  (WRB)
C   891006  REVISION DATE from Version 3.2
C   891214  Prologue converted to Version 4.0 format.  (BAB)
C   900328  Added TYPE section.  (WRB)
C   910408  Updated AUTHOR section in prologue.  (WRB)
C   930503  Improved purpose.  (FNF)
