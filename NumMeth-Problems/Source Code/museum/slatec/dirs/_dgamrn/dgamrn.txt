C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Abstract   * A Double Precision Routine *
C         DGAMRN computes the GAMMA function ratio GAMMA(X)/GAMMA(X+0.5)
C         for real X.gt.0. If X.ge.XMIN, an asymptotic expansion is
C         evaluated. If X.lt.XMIN, an integer is added to X to form a
C         new value of X.ge.XMIN and the asymptotic expansion is eval-
C         uated for this new value of X. Successive application of the
C         recurrence relation
C
C                      W(X)=W(X+1)*(1+0.5/X)
C
C         reduces the argument to its original value. XMIN and comp-
C         utational tolerances are computed as a function of the number
C         of digits carried in a word by calls to I1MACH and D1MACH.
C         However, the computational accuracy is limited to the max-
C         imum of unit roundoff (=D1MACH(4)) and 1.0D-18 since critical
C         constants are given to only 18 digits.
C
C         Input      X is Double Precision
C           X      - Argument, X.gt.0.0D0
C
C         Output      DGAMRN is DOUBLE PRECISION
C           DGAMRN  - Ratio  GAMMA(X)/GAMMA(X+0.5)
