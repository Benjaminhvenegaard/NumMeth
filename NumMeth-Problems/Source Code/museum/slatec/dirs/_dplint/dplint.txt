C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Abstract
C        Subroutine DPLINT is designed to produce the polynomial which
C     interpolates the data  (X(I),Y(I)), I=1,...,N.  DPLINT sets up
C     information in the array C which can be used by subroutine DPOLVL
C     to evaluate the polynomial and its derivatives and by subroutine
C     DPOLCF to produce the coefficients.

C     Formal Parameters
C     *** All TYPE REAL variables are DOUBLE PRECISION ***
C     N  - the number of data points  (N .GE. 1)
C     X  - the array of abscissas (all of which must be distinct)
C     Y  - the array of ordinates
C     C  - an array of information used by subroutines
C     *******  Dimensioning Information  *******
C     Arrays X,Y, and C must be dimensioned at least N in the calling
C     program.
