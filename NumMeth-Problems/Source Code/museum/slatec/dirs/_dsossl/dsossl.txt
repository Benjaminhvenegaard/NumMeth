C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     DSOSSL solves an upper triangular type of linear system by back
C     substitution.
C
C     The matrix C is upper trapezoidal and stored as a linear array by
C     rows. The equations have been normalized so that the diagonal
C     entries of C are understood to be unity. The off diagonal entries
C     and the elements of the constant right hand side vector B have
C     already been stored as the negatives of the corresponding equation
C     values.
C     With each call to DSOSSL a (K-1) by (K-1) triangular system is
C     resolved. For L greater than K, column L of C is included in the
C     right hand side vector.
