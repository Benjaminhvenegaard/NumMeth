C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure BANDRD,
C     NUM. MATH. 12, 231-241(1968) by Schwarz.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 273-283(1971).
C
C     This subroutine reduces a REAL SYMMETRIC BAND matrix
C     to a symmetric tridiagonal matrix using and optionally
C     accumulating orthogonal similarity transformations.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional
C          array parameters, A and Z, as declared in the calling
C          program dimension statement.  NM is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix A.  N is an INTEGER variable.
C          N must be less than or equal to NM.
C
C        MB is the (half) band width of the matrix, defined as the
C          number of adjacent diagonals, including the principal
C          diagonal, required to specify the non-zero portion of the
C          lower triangle of the matrix.  MB is less than or equal
C          to N.  MB is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        A contains the lower triangle of the real symmetric band
C          matrix.  Its lowest subdiagonal is stored in the last
C          N+1-MB  positions of the first column, its next subdiagonal
C          in the last  N+2-MB  positions of the second column, further
C          subdiagonals similarly, and finally its principal diagonal
C          in the  N  positions of the last column.  Contents of storage
C          locations not part of the matrix are arbitrary.  A is a
C          two-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned A(NM,MB).
C
C        MATZ should be set to .TRUE. if the transformation matrix is
C          to be accumulated, and to .FALSE. otherwise.  MATZ is a
C          LOGICAL variable.
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        A has been destroyed, except for its last two columns which
C          contain a copy of the tridiagonal matrix.
C
C        D contains the diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix.
C          D is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned D(N).
C
C        E contains the subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
C          matrix in its last N-1 positions.  E(1) is set to zero.
C          E is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned E(N).
C
C        E2 contains the squares of the corresponding elements of E.
C          E2 may coincide with E if the squares are not needed.
C          E2 is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned E2(N).
C
C        Z contains the orthogonal transformation matrix produced in
C          the reduction if MATZ has been set to .TRUE.  Otherwise, Z
C          is not referenced.  Z is a two-dimensional REAL array,
C          dimensioned Z(NM,N).
