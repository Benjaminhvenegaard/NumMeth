C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     INTEGER VECTOR OUTPUT ROUTINE.
C
C  INPUT..
C
C  N,IX(*) PRINT THE INTEGER ARRAY IX(I),I=1,...,N, ON OUTPUT
C          UNIT LOUT. THE HEADING IN THE FORTRAN FORMAT
C          STATEMENT IFMT(*), DESCRIBED BELOW, IS PRINTED AS A FIRST
C          STEP. THE COMPONENTS IX(I) ARE INDEXED, ON OUTPUT,
C          IN A PLEASANT FORMAT.
C  IFMT(*) A FORTRAN FORMAT STATEMENT. THIS IS PRINTED ON OUTPUT
C          UNIT LOUT WITH THE VARIABLE FORMAT FORTRAN STATEMENT
C                WRITE(LOUT,IFMT)
C  IDIGIT  PRINT UP TO ABS(IDIGIT) DECIMAL DIGITS PER NUMBER.
C          THE SUBPROGRAM WILL CHOOSE THAT INTEGER 4,6,10 OR 14
C          WHICH WILL PRINT AT LEAST ABS(IDIGIT) NUMBER OF
C          PLACES.  IF IDIGIT.LT.0, 72 PRINTING COLUMNS ARE UTILIZED
C          TO WRITE EACH LINE OF OUTPUT OF THE ARRAY IX(*). (THIS
C          CAN BE USED ON MOST TIME-SHARING TERMINALS). IF
C          IDIGIT.GE.0, 133 PRINTING COLUMNS ARE UTILIZED. (THIS CAN
C          BE USED ON MOST LINE PRINTERS).
C
C  EXAMPLE..
C
C  PRINT AN ARRAY CALLED (COSTS OF PURCHASES) OF LENGTH 100 SHOWING
C  6 DECIMAL DIGITS PER NUMBER. THE USER IS RUNNING ON A TIME-SHARING
C  SYSTEM WITH A 72 COLUMN OUTPUT DEVICE.
C
C     DIMENSION ICOSTS(100)
C     N = 100
C     IDIGIT = -6
C     CALL IVOUT(N,ICOSTS,'(''1COSTS OF PURCHASES'')',IDIGIT)
