C        PARAMETERS
C         ON ENTRY
C           F      - Real
C                    Function subprogram defining the integrand
C                    function F(X). The actual name for F needs to be
C                    declared E X T E R N A L in the calling program.
C
C           A      - Real
C                    Lower limit of integration
C
C           B      - Real
C                    Upper limit of integration
C
C         ON RETURN
C           RESULT - Real
C                    Approximation to the integral I
C                    RESULT is computed by applying the 61-point
C                    Kronrod rule (RESK) obtained by optimal addition of
C                    abscissae to the 30-point Gauss rule (RESG).
C
C           ABSERR - Real
C                    Estimate of the modulus of the absolute error,
C                    which should equal or exceed ABS(I-RESULT)
C
C           RESABS - Real
C                    Approximation to the integral J
C
C           RESASC - Real
C                    Approximation to the integral of ABS(F-I/(B-A))
