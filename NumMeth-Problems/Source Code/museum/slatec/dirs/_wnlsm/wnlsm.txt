C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This is a companion subprogram to WNNLS.
C     The documentation for WNNLS has complete usage instructions.
C
C     In addition to the parameters discussed in the prologue to
C     subroutine WNNLS, the following work arrays are used in
C     subroutine WNLSM  (they are passed through the calling
C     sequence from WNNLS for purposes of variable dimensioning).
C     Their contents will in general be of no interest to the user.
C
C         IPIVOT(*)
C            An array of length N.  Upon completion it contains the
C         pivoting information for the cols of W(*,*).
C
C         ITYPE(*)
C            An array of length M which is used to keep track
C         of the classification of the equations.  ITYPE(I)=0
C         denotes equation I as an equality constraint.
C         ITYPE(I)=1 denotes equation I as a least squares
C         equation.
C
C         WD(*)
C            An array of length N.  Upon completion it contains the
C         dual solution vector.
C
C         H(*)
C            An array of length N.  Upon completion it contains the
C         pivot scalars of the Householder transformations performed
C         in the case KRANK.LT.L.
C
C         SCALE(*)
C            An array of length M which is used by the subroutine
C         to store the diagonal matrix of weights.
C         These are used to apply the modified Givens
C         transformations.
C
C         Z(*),TEMP(*)
C            Working arrays of length N.
C
C         D(*)
C            An array of length N that contains the
C         column scaling for the matrix (E).
C                                       (A)
