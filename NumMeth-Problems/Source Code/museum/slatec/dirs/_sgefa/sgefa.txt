C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     SGEFA factors a real matrix by Gaussian elimination.
C
C     SGEFA is usually called by SGECO, but it can be called
C     directly with a saving in time if  RCOND  is not needed.
C     (Time for SGECO) = (1 + 9/N)*(Time for SGEFA) .
C
C     On Entry
C
C        A       REAL(LDA, N)
C                the matrix to be factored.
C
C        LDA     INTEGER
C                the leading dimension of the array  A .
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the matrix  A .
C
C     On Return
C
C        A       an upper triangular matrix and the multipliers
C                which were used to obtain it.
C                The factorization can be written  A = L*U , where
C                L  is a product of permutation and unit lower
C                triangular matrices and  U  is upper triangular.
C
C        IPVT    INTEGER(N)
C                an integer vector of pivot indices.
C
C        INFO    INTEGER
C                = 0  normal value.
C                = K  if  U(K,K) .EQ. 0.0 .  This is not an error
C                     condition for this subroutine, but it does
C                     indicate that SGESL or SGEDI will divide by zero
C                     if called.  Use  RCOND  in SGECO for a reliable
C                     indication of singularity.
