C***TYPE      SINGLE PRECISION (SPELIP-S)
C***AUTHOR  (UNKNOWN)
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     SPELIP sets up vectors and arrays for input to BLKTRI
C     and computes a second order solution in USOL.  A return jump to
C     SEPELI occurs if IORDER=2.  If IORDER=4 a fourth order
C     solution is generated in USOL.
