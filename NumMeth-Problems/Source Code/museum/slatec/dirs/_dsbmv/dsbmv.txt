C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  DSBMV  performs the matrix-vector  operation
C
C     y := alpha*A*x + beta*y,
C
C  where alpha and beta are scalars, x and y are n element vectors and
C  A is an n by n symmetric band matrix, with k super-diagonals.

C  Parameters
C  ==========
C
C  UPLO   - CHARACTER*1.
C           On entry, UPLO specifies whether the upper or lower
C           triangular part of the band matrix A is being supplied as
C           follows:
C
C              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   The upper triangular part of A is
C                                  being supplied.
C
C              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   The lower triangular part of A is
C                                  being supplied.
C
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  N      - INTEGER.
C           On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A.
C           N must be at least zero.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  K      - INTEGER.
C           On entry, K specifies the number of super-diagonals of the
C           matrix A. K must satisfy  0 .le. K.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  ALPHA  - DOUBLE PRECISION.
C           On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  A      - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION ( LDA, n ).
C           Before entry with UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the leading ( k + 1 )
C           by n part of the array A must contain the upper triangular
C           band part of the symmetric matrix, supplied column by
C           column, with the leading diagonal of the matrix in row
C           ( k + 1 ) of the array, the first super-diagonal starting at
C           position 2 in row k, and so on. The top left k by k triangle
C           of the array A is not referenced.
C           The following program segment will transfer the upper
C           triangular part of a symmetric band matrix from conventional
C           full matrix storage to band storage:
C
C                 DO 20, J = 1, N
C                    M = K + 1 - J
C                    DO 10, I = MAX( 1, J - K ), J
C                       A( M + I, J ) = matrix( I, J )

C
C           Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the leading ( k + 1 )
C           by n part of the array A must contain the lower triangular

C           column, with the leading diagonal of the matrix in row 1 of
C           the array, the first sub-diagonal starting at position 1 in

C           array A is not referenced.
C           The following program segment will transfer the lower
C           triangular part of a symmetric band matrix from conventional
C           full matrix storage to band storage:
C
C                 DO 20, J = 1, N
C                    M = 1 - J
C                    DO 10, I = J, MIN( N, J + K )
C                       A( M + I, J ) = matrix( I, J )
