C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   Evaluate Tricomi's incomplete gamma function defined by
C
C   GAMIT = X**(-A)/GAMMA(A) * integral from 0 to X of EXP(-T) *
C             T**(A-1.)
C
C   for A .GT. 0.0 and by analytic continuation for A .LE. 0.0.
C   GAMMA(X) is the complete gamma function of X.
C
C   GAMIT is evaluated for arbitrary real values of A and for non-
C   negative values of X (even though GAMIT is defined for X .LT.
C   0.0), except that for X = 0 and A .LE. 0.0, GAMIT is infinite,
C   which is a fatal error.
C
C   The function and both arguments are REAL.
C
C   A slight deterioration of 2 or 3 digits accuracy will occur when
C   GAMIT is very large or very small in absolute value, because log-
C   arithmic variables are used.  Also, if the parameter  A  is very
C   close to a negative integer (but not a negative integer), there is
C   a loss of accuracy, which is reported if the result is less than
C   half machine precision.
