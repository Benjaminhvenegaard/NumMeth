C***PURPOSE  Compute the backward fast Fourier transform of a real
C            coefficient array.
C***LIBRARY   SLATEC (FFTPACK)
C***CATEGORY  J1A1
C***TYPE      SINGLE PRECISION (RFFTB1-S, CFFTB1-C)
C***KEYWORDS  FFTPACK, FOURIER TRANSFORM
C***AUTHOR  Swarztrauber, P. N., (NCAR)
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   Subroutine RFFTB1 computes the real periodic sequence from its
C   Fourier coefficients (Fourier synthesis).  The transform is defined
C   below at output parameter C.
C
C   The arrays WA and IFAC which are used by subroutine RFFTB1 must be
C   initialized by calling subroutine RFFTI1.
C
C   Input Arguments
C
C   N       the length of the array R to be transformed.  The method
C           is most efficient when N is a product of small primes.
C           N may change so long as different work arrays are provided.
C
C   C       a real array of length N which contains the sequence
C           to be transformed.
C
C   CH      a real work array of length at least N.
C
C   WA      a real work array which must be dimensioned at least N.
C
C   IFAC    an integer work array which must be dimensioned at least 15.
C
C           The WA and IFAC arrays must be initialized by calling
C           subroutine RFFTI1, and different WA and IFAC arrays must be
C           used for each different value of N.  This initialization
C           does not have to be repeated so long as N remains unchanged.
C           Thus subsequent transforms can be obtained faster than the
C           first.  The same WA and IFAC arrays can be used by RFFTF1
C           and RFFTB1.
C
C   Output Argument
C
C   C       For N even and for I = 1,...,N
C
C                C(I) = C(1)+(-1)**(I-1)*C(N)
C
C                     plus the sum from K=2 to K=N/2 of
C
C                      2.*C(2*K-2)*COS((K-1)*(I-1)*2*PI/N)
C
C                     -2.*C(2*K-1)*SIN((K-1)*(I-1)*2*PI/N)
C
C           For N odd and for I = 1,...,N
C
C                C(I) = C(1) plus the sum from K=2 to K=(N+1)/2 of
C
C                     2.*C(2*K-2)*COS((K-1)*(I-1)*2*PI/N)
C
C                    -2.*C(2*K-1)*SIN((K-1)*(I-1)*2*PI/N)
C
C   Notes:  This transform is unnormalized since a call of RFFTF1
C           followed by a call of RFFTB1 will multiply the input
C           sequence by N.
C
C           WA and IFAC contain initialization calculations which must
C           not be destroyed between calls of subroutine RFFTF1 or
C           RFFTB1.
