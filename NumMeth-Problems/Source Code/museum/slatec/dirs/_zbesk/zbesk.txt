C                      ***A DOUBLE PRECISION ROUTINE***
C         On KODE=1, ZBESK computes an N member sequence of complex
C         Bessel functions CY(L)=K(FNU+L-1,Z) for real nonnegative
C         orders FNU+L-1, L=1,...,N and complex Z.NE.0 in the cut
C         plane -pi<arg(Z)<=pi where Z=ZR+i*ZI.  On KODE=2, CBESJ
C         returns the scaled functions
C
C            CY(L) = exp(Z)*K(FNU+L-1,Z),  L=1,...,N
C
C         which remove the exponential growth in both the left and
C         right half planes as Z goes to infinity.  Definitions and
C         notation are found in the NBS Handbook of Mathematical
C         Functions (Ref. 1).

C *Long Description:
C
C         Equations of the reference are implemented to compute K(a,z)
C         for small orders a and a+1 in the right half plane Re(z)>=0.
C         Forward recurrence generates higher orders.  The formula
C
C            K(a,z*exp((t)) = exp(-t)*K(a,z) - t*I(a,z),  Re(z)>0
C                         t = i*pi or -i*pi
C
C         continues K to the left half plane.
C
C         For large orders, K(a,z) is computed by means of its uniform
C         asymptotic expansion.
C
C         For negative orders, the formula
C
C            K(-a,z) = K(a,z)
C
C         can be used.
C
C         CBESK assumes that a significant digit sinh function is
C         available.
C
C         In most complex variable computation, one must evaluate ele-
C         mentary functions.  When the magnitude of Z or FNU+N-1 is
C         large, losses of significance by argument reduction occur.
C         Consequently, if either one exceeds U1=SQRT(0.5/UR), then
C         losses exceeding half precision are likely and an error flag
C         IERR=3 is triggered where UR=MAX(D1MACH(4),1.0D-18) is double
C         precision unit roundoff limited to 18 digits precision.  Also,
C         if either is larger than U2=0.5/UR, then all significance is
C         lost and IERR=4.  In order to use the INT function, arguments
C         must be further restricted not to exceed the largest machine
C         integer, U3=I1MACH(9).  Thus, the magnitude of Z and FNU+N-1
C         is restricted by MIN(U2,U3).  In IEEE arithmetic, U1,U2, and
C         U3 approximate 2.0E+3, 4.2E+6, 2.1E+9 in single precision
C         and 4.7E+7, 2.3E+15 and 2.1E+9 in double precision.  This
C         makes U2 limiting in single precision and U3 limiting in
C         double precision.  This means that one can expect to retain,
C         in the worst cases on IEEE machines, no digits in single pre-
C         cision and only 6 digits in double precision.  Similar con-
C         siderations hold for other machines.
C
C         The approximate relative error in the magnitude of a complex
C         Bessel function can be expressed as P*10**S where P=MAX(UNIT
C         ROUNDOFF,1.0E-18) is the nominal precision and 10**S repre-
C         sents the increase in error due to argument reduction in the
C         elementary functions.  Here, S=MAX(1,ABS(LOG10(ABS(Z))),
C         ABS(LOG10(FNU))) approximately (i.e., S=MAX(1,ABS(EXPONENT OF
C         ABS(Z),ABS(EXPONENT OF FNU)) ).  However, the phase angle may
C         have only absolute accuracy.  This is most likely to occur
C         when one component (in magnitude) is larger than the other by
C         several orders of magnitude.  If one component is 10**K larger
C         than the other, then one can expect only MAX(ABS(LOG10(P))-K,
C         0) significant digits; or, stated another way, when K exceeds
C         the exponent of P, no significant digits remain in the smaller
C         component.  However, the phase angle retains absolute accuracy
C         because, in complex arithmetic with precision P, the smaller
C         component will not (as a rule) decrease below P times the
C         magnitude of the larger component.  In these extreme cases,
C         the principal phase angle is on the order of +P, -P, PI/2-P,
C         or -PI/2+P.
