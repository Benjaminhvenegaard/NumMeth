C***DESCRIPTION
C
C Evaluate  EXPREL(X) = (EXP(X) - 1.0) / X.   For small ABS(X) the
C Taylor series is used.  If X is negative, the reflection formula
C         EXPREL(X) = EXP(X) * EXPREL(ABS(X))
C may be used.  This reflection formula will be of use when the
C evaluation for small ABS(X) is done by Chebyshev series rather than
C Taylor series.  EXPREL and X are single precision.
