C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  SSYR2K  performs one of the symmetric rank 2k operations
C
C     C := alpha*A*B' + alpha*B*A' + beta*C,
C
C  or
C
C     C := alpha*A'*B + alpha*B'*A + beta*C,
C
C  where  alpha and beta  are scalars, C is an  n by n  symmetric matrix
C  and  A and B  are  n by k  matrices  in the  first  case  and  k by n
C  matrices in the second case.

C           On  entry,   UPLO  specifies  whether  the  upper  or  lower
C           triangular  part  of the  array  C  is to be  referenced  as
C           follows:
C
C              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   Only the  upper triangular part of  C
