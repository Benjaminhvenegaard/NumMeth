C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Abstract  **** a double precision routine ****
C         DBESI computes an N member sequence of I Bessel functions
C         I/sub(ALPHA+K-1)/(X), K=1,...,N or scaled Bessel functions
C         EXP(-X)*I/sub(ALPHA+K-1)/(X), K=1,...,N for nonnegative ALPHA
C         and X.  A combination of the power series, the asymptotic
C         expansion for X to infinity, and the uniform asymptotic
C         expansion for NU to infinity are applied over subdivisions of
C         the (NU,X) plane.  For values not covered by one of these
C         formulae, the order is incremented by an integer so that one
C         of these formulae apply.  Backward recursion is used to reduce
C         orders by integer values.  The asymptotic expansion for X to
C         infinity is used only when the entire sequence (specifically
C         the last member) lies within the region covered by the
C         expansion.  Leading terms of these expansions are used to test
C         for over or underflow where appropriate.  If a sequence is
C         requested and the last member would underflow, the result is
C         set to zero and the next lower order tried, etc., until a
C         member comes on scale or all are set to zero.  An overflow
C         cannot occur with scaling.
C
C         The maximum number of significant digits obtainable
C         is the smaller of 14 and the number of digits carried in
C         double precision arithmetic.

C     Description of Arguments
C
C         Input      X,ALPHA are double precision
C           X      - X .GE. 0.0D0
C           ALPHA  - order of first member of the sequence,
C                    ALPHA .GE. 0.0D0
C           KODE   - a parameter to indicate the scaling option
C                    KODE=1 returns
C                           Y(K)=        I/sub(ALPHA+K-1)/(X),
C                                K=1,...,N

C                           Y(K)=EXP(-X)*I/sub(ALPHA+K-1)/(X),
C                                K=1,...,N
C           N      - number of members in the sequence, N .GE. 1
C
C         Output     Y is double precision
C           Y      - a vector whose first N components contain
C                    values for I/sub(ALPHA+K-1)/(X) or scaled
C                    values for EXP(-X)*I/sub(ALPHA+K-1)/(X),
C                    K=1,...,N depending on KODE
C           NZ     - number of components of Y set to zero due to
C                    underflow,
C                    NZ=0   , normal return, computation completed
C                    NZ .NE. 0, last NZ components of Y set to zero,
C                             Y(K)=0.0D0, K=N-NZ+1,...,N.
C
C     Error Conditions
C         Improper input arguments - a fatal error
C         Overflow with KODE=1 - a fatal error
C         Underflow - a non-fatal error(NZ .NE. 0)
