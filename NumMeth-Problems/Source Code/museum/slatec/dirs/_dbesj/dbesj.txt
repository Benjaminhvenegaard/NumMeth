C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Abstract  **** a double precision routine ****
C         DBESJ computes an N member sequence of J Bessel functions
C         J/sub(ALPHA+K-1)/(X), K=1,...,N for non-negative ALPHA and X.
C         A combination of the power series, the asymptotic expansion
C         for X to infinity and the uniform asymptotic expansion for
C         NU to infinity are applied over subdivisions of the (NU,X)
C         plane.  For values of (NU,X) not covered by one of these
C         formulae, the order is incremented or decremented by integer
C         values into a region where one of the formulae apply. Backward
C         recursion is applied to reduce orders by integer values except
C         where the entire sequence lies in the oscillatory region.  In
C         this case forward recursion is stable and values from the
C         asymptotic expansion for X to infinity start the recursion
C         when it is efficient to do so. Leading terms of the series and
C         uniform expansion are tested for underflow.  If a sequence is
C         requested and the last member would underflow, the result is
C         set to zero and the next lower order tried, etc., until a
C         member comes on scale or all members are set to zero.
C         Overflow cannot occur.
C
C         The maximum number of significant digits obtainable
C         is the smaller of 14 and the number of digits carried in
C         double precision arithmetic.

C     Description of Arguments
C
C         Input      X,ALPHA are double precision
C           X      - X .GE. 0.0D0
C           ALPHA  - order of first member of the sequence,
C                    ALPHA .GE. 0.0D0
C           N      - number of members in the sequence, N .GE. 1
C
C         Output     Y is double precision
C           Y      - a vector whose first N components contain
C                    values for J/sub(ALPHA+K-1)/(X), K=1,...,N
C           NZ     - number of components of Y set to zero due to
C                    underflow,
C                    NZ=0   , normal return, computation completed
C                    NZ .NE. 0, last NZ components of Y set to zero,
C                             Y(K)=0.0D0, K=N-NZ+1,...,N.
