C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  SGER   performs the rank 1 operation
C
C     A := alpha*x*y' + A,
C
C  where alpha is a scalar, x is an m element vector, y is an n element
C  vector and A is an m by n matrix.
C
C  Parameters
C  ==========
C
C  M      - INTEGER.
C           On entry, M specifies the number of rows of the matrix A.
C           M must be at least zero.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  N      - INTEGER.
C           On entry, N specifies the number of columns of the matrix A.
C           N must be at least zero.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  ALPHA  - REAL            .
C           On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  X      - REAL             array of dimension at least
C           ( 1 + ( m - 1)*abs( INCX)).
C           Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the m
C           element vector x.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  INCX   - INTEGER.
C           On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of
C           X. INCX must not be zero.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  Y      - REAL             array of dimension at least
C           ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCY ) ).
C           Before entry, the incremented array Y must contain the n
C           element vector y.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  INCY   - INTEGER.
C           On entry, INCY specifies the increment for the elements of
C           Y. INCY must not be zero.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  A      - REAL             array of DIMENSION ( LDA, n ).
C           Before entry, the leading m by n part of the array A must
C           contain the matrix of coefficients. On exit, A is
C           overwritten by the updated matrix.
C
C  LDA    - INTEGER.
C           On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
C           in the calling (sub) program. LDA must be at least
C           max( 1, m ).
C           Unchanged on exit.
