C***PURPOSE  SLAP MTSOLV for LDU Factorization.
C            This routine acts as an interface between the SLAP generic
C            MTSOLV calling convention and the routine that actually
C                           -T
C            computes  (LDU)  B = X.

C***DESCRIPTION
C       It is assumed that RWORK and IWORK have initialized with
C       the information required for DSLUI4:
C          IWORK(1) = Starting location of IL in IWORK.
C          IWORK(2) = Starting location of JL in IWORK.
C          IWORK(3) = Starting location of IU in IWORK.
C          IWORK(4) = Starting location of JU in IWORK.
C          IWORK(5) = Starting location of L in RWORK.
C          IWORK(6) = Starting location of DINV in RWORK.
C          IWORK(7) = Starting location of U in RWORK.
C       See the DESCRIPTION of DSLUI4 for details.
