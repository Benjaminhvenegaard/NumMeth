C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine computes a forward-difference approximation
C     to the N by N Jacobian matrix associated with a specified
C     problem of N functions in N VARIABLES. If the Jacobian has
C     a banded form, then function evaluations are saved by only
C     approximating the nonzero terms.
C
C     The subroutine statement is
C
C       SUBROUTINE FDJAC1(FCN,N,X,FVEC,FJAC,LDFJAC,IFLAG,ML,MU,EPSFCN,
C                         WA1,WA2)
C
C     where
C
C       FCN is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which
C         calculates the functions. FCN must be declared
C         in an external statement in the user calling
C         program, and should be written as follows.
C
C         SUBROUTINE FCN(N,X,FVEC,IFLAG)
C         INTEGER N,IFLAG
C         REAL X(N),FVEC(N)
C         ----------
C         Calculate the functions at X and
C         return this vector in FVEC.
C         ----------
C         RETURN
C         END
C
C         The value of IFLAG should not be changed by FCN unless
C         the user wants to terminate execution of FDJAC1.
C         In this case set IFLAG to a negative integer.
C
C       N Is a positive integer input variable set to the number
C         of functions and variables.
C
C       X is an input array of length N.
C
C       FVEC is an input array of length N which must contain the
C         functions evaluated at X.
C
C       FJAC is an output N by N array which contains the
C         approximation to the Jacobian matrix evaluated at X.
C
C       LDFJAC is a positive integer input variable not less than N
C         which specifies the leading dimension of the array FJAC.
C
C       IFLAG is an integer variable which can be used to terminate
C         the execution of FDJAC1. See description of FCN.
C
C       ML is a nonnegative integer input variable which specifies
C         the number of subdiagonals within the band of the
C         Jacobian matrix. If the Jacobian is not banded, set
C         ML to at least N - 1.
C
C       EPSFCN is an input variable used in determining a suitable
C         step length for the forward-difference approximation. This
C         approximation assumes that the relative errors in the
C         functions are of the order of EPSFCN. If EPSFCN is less
C         than the machine precision, it is assumed that the relative
C         errors in the functions are of the order of the machine
C         precision.
C
C       MU is a nonnegative integer input variable which specifies
C         the number of superdiagonals within the band of the
C         Jacobian matrix. If the Jacobian is not banded, set
C         MU to at least N - 1.
C
C       WA1 and WA2 are work arrays of length N. If ML + MU + 1 is at
C         least N, then the Jacobian is considered dense, and WA2 is
C         not referenced.
