C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     PCHNGS LIMITS THE TYPE OF STORAGE TO A SEQUENTIAL SCHEME.
C     SPARSE MATRIX ELEMENT ALTERATION SUBROUTINE.
C
C     SUBROUTINE PCHNGS() CHANGES ELEMENT II IN VECTOR +/- IRCX TO THE
C     VALUE XVAL.
C
C            II THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF THIS INTEGER IS THE SUBSCRIPT FOR
C               THE ELEMENT TO BE CHANGED.
C          XVAL NEW VALUE OF THE MATRIX ELEMENT BEING CHANGED.
C     IPLACE POINTER INFORMATION WHICH IS MAINTAINED BY THE PACKAGE.
C   SX(*),IX(*) THE WORK ARRAYS WHICH ARE USED TO STORE THE SPARSE
C               MATRIX. THESE ARRAYS ARE AUTOMATICALLY MAINTAINED BY THE
C               PACKAGE FOR THE USER.
C          IRCX POINTS TO THE VECTOR OF THE MATRIX BEING UPDATED.
C               A NEGATIVE VALUE OF IRCX INDICATES THAT ROW -IRCX IS
C               BEING UPDATED.  A POSITIVE VALUE OF IRCX INDICATES THAT
C               COLUMN IRCX IS BEING UPDATED.  A ZERO VALUE OF IRCX IS
C               AN ERROR.
C
C     SINCE DATA ITEMS ARE KEPT SORTED IN THE SEQUENTIAL DATA STRUCTURE,
C     CHANGING A MATRIX ELEMENT CAN REQUIRE THE MOVEMENT OF ALL THE DATA
C     ITEMS IN THE MATRIX. FOR THIS REASON, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT DATA
C     ITEMS BE ADDED A COL. AT A TIME, IN ASCENDING COL. SEQUENCE.
C     FURTHERMORE, SINCE DELETING ITEMS FROM THE DATA STRUCTURE MAY ALSO
C     REQUIRE MOVING LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA, ZERO ELEMENTS ARE EXPLICITLY
C     STORED IN THE MATRIX.
C
C     THIS SUBROUTINE IS A MODIFICATION OF THE SUBROUTINE LCHNGS,
C     SANDIA LABS. REPT. SAND78-0785.
