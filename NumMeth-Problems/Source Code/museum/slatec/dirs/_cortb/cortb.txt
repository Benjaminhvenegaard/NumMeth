C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of a complex analogue of
C     the ALGOL procedure ORTBAK, NUM. MATH. 12, 349-368(1968)

C
C     This subroutine forms the eigenvectors of a COMPLEX GENERAL
C     matrix by back transforming those of the corresponding
C     upper Hessenberg matrix determined by  CORTH.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional
C          array parameters, AR, AI, ZR, and ZI, as declared in the
C          calling program dimension statement.  NM is an INTEGER
C          variable.
C
C        LOW and IGH are two INTEGER variables determined by the
C          balancing subroutine  CBAL.  If  CBAL  has not been used,
C          set LOW=1 and IGH equal to the order of the matrix.
C
C        AR and AI contain information about the unitary trans-
C          formations used in the reduction by  CORTH  in their
C          strict lower triangles.  AR and AI are two-dimensional
C          REAL arrays, dimensioned AR(NM,IGH) and AI(NM,IGH).
C
C        ORTR and ORTI contain further information about the unitary
C          transformations used in the reduction by  CORTH.  Only
C          elements LOW through IGH are used.  ORTR and ORTI are
C          one-dimensional REAL arrays, dimensioned ORTR(IGH) and
C          ORTI(IGH).
C
C        M is the number of columns of Z=(ZR,ZI) to be back transformed.
C          M is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        ZR and ZI contain the real and imaginary parts, respectively,
C          of the eigenvectors to be back transformed in their first
C          M columns.  ZR and ZI are two-dimensional REAL arrays,
C          dimensioned ZR(NM,M) and ZI(NM,M).
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        ZR and ZI contain the real and imaginary parts, respectively,
C          of the transformed eigenvectors in their first M columns.
C
C        ORTR and ORTI have been altered.
C
C     Note that CORTB preserves vector Euclidean norms.
