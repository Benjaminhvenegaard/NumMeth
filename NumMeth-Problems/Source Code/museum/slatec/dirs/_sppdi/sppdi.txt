C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     SPPDI computes the determinant and inverse
C     of a real symmetric positive definite matrix
C     using the factors computed by SPPCO or SPPFA .
C
C     On Entry
C
C        AP      REAL (N*(N+1)/2)
C                the output from SPPCO or SPPFA.
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the matrix  A .
C
C        JOB     INTEGER
C                = 11   both determinant and inverse.
C                = 01   inverse only.
C                = 10   determinant only.
C
C     On Return
C
C        AP      the upper triangular half of the inverse .
C                The strict lower triangle is unaltered.
C
C        DET     REAL(2)
C                determinant of original matrix if requested.
C                Otherwise not referenced.
C                Determinant = DET(1) * 10.0**DET(2)
C                with  1.0 .LE. DET(1) .LT. 10.0
C                or  DET(1) .EQ. 0.0 .
C
C     Error Condition
C
C        A division by zero will occur if the input factor contains
C        a zero on the diagonal and the inverse is requested.
C        It will not occur if the subroutines are called correctly
C        and if SPOCO or SPOFA has set INFO .EQ. 0 .
