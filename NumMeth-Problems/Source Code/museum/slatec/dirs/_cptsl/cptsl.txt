C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     CPTSL given a positive definite tridiagonal matrix and a right
C     hand side will find the solution.
C
C     On Entry
C
C        N        INTEGER
C                 is the order of the tridiagonal matrix.
C
C        D        COMPLEX(N)
C                 is the diagonal of the tridiagonal matrix.
C                 On output D is destroyed.
C
C        E        COMPLEX(N)
C                 is the offdiagonal of the tridiagonal matrix.
C                 E(1) through E(N-1) should contain the
C                 offdiagonal.
C
C        B        COMPLEX(N)
C                 is the right hand side vector.
C
C     On Return
C
C        B        contains the solution.
