C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine first approximates the truncation error given by
C     TRUN1(X,Y)=DLX**2*TX+DLY**2*TY where
C     TX=AFUN(X)*UXXXX/12.0+BFUN(X)*UXXX/6.0 on the interior and
C     at the boundaries if periodic (here UXXX,UXXXX are the third
C     and fourth partial derivatives of U with respect to X).
C     TX is of the form AFUN(X)/3.0*(UXXXX/4.0+UXXX/DLX)
C     at X=A or X=B if the boundary condition there is mixed.
C     TX=0.0 along specified boundaries.  TY has symmetric form
C     in Y with X,AFUN(X),BFUN(X) replaced by Y,DFUN(Y),EFUN(Y).
C     The second order solution in USOL is used to approximate
C     (via second order finite differencing) the truncation error
C     and the result is added to the right hand side in GRHS
C     and then transferred to USOL to be used as a new right
C     hand side when calling BLKTRI for a fourth order solution.
