C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the inverse iteration tech-
C     nique in the ALGOL procedure TRISTURM by Peters and Wilkinson.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 418-439(1971).
C
C     This subroutine finds those eigenvectors of a TRIDIAGONAL
C     SYMMETRIC matrix corresponding to specified eigenvalues,
C     using inverse iteration.
C
C     On Input
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional
C          array parameter, Z, as declared in the calling program
C          dimension statement.  NM is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix.  N is an INTEGER variable.
C          N must be less than or equal to NM.
C
C        D contains the diagonal elements of the symmetric tridiagonal
C          matrix.  D is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned D(N).
C
C        E contains the subdiagonal elements of the symmetric
C          tridiagonal matrix in its last N-1 positions.  E(1) is
C          arbitrary.  E is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned
C          E(N).
C
C        E2 contains the squares of the corresponding elements of E,
C          with zeros corresponding to negligible elements of E.
C          E(I) is considered negligible if it is not larger than
C          the product of the relative machine precision and the sum
C          of the magnitudes of D(I) and D(I-1).  E2(1) must contain
C          0.0e0 if the eigenvalues are in ascending order, or 2.0e0
C          if the eigenvalues are in descending order.  If  BISECT,
C          TRIDIB, or  IMTQLV  has been used to find the eigenvalues,
C          their output E2 array is exactly what is expected here.
C          E2 is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned E2(N).
C
C        M is the number of specified eigenvalues for which eigenvectors
C          are to be determined.  M is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        W contains the M eigenvalues in ascending or descending order.
C          W is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned W(M).
C
C        IND contains in its first M positions the submatrix indices
C          associated with the corresponding eigenvalues in W --
C          1 for eigenvalues belonging to the first submatrix from
C          the top, 2 for those belonging to the second submatrix, etc.
C          If  BISECT  or  TRIDIB  has been used to determine the
C          eigenvalues, their output IND array is suitable for input
C          to TINVIT.  IND is a one-dimensional INTEGER array,
C          dimensioned IND(M).
C
C     On Output
C
C       ** All input arrays are unaltered.**
C
C        Z contains the associated set of orthonormal eigenvectors.
C          Any vector which fails to converge is set to zero.
C          Z is a two-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned Z(NM,M).
C
C        IERR is an INTEGER flag set to
C          Zero       for normal return,
C          -J         if the eigenvector corresponding to the J-th
C                     eigenvalue fails to converge in 5 iterations.
C
C        RV1, RV2 and RV3 are one-dimensional REAL arrays used for
C          temporary storage.  They are used to store the main diagonal
C          and the two adjacent diagonals of the triangular matrix
C          produced in the inverse iteration process.  RV1, RV2 and
C          RV3 are dimensioned RV1(N), RV2(N) and RV3(N).
C
C        RV4 and RV6 are one-dimensional REAL arrays used for temporary
C          storage.  RV4 holds the multipliers of the Gaussian
C          elimination process.  RV6 holds the approximate eigenvectors
C          in this process.  RV4 and RV6 are dimensioned RV4(N) and
C          RV6(N).
