C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Abstract  **** A DOUBLE PRECISION routine ****
C         DBSYNU computes N member sequences of Y Bessel functions
C         Y/SUB(FNU+I-1)/(X), I=1,N for non-negative orders FNU and
C         positive X. Equations of the references are implemented on
C         small orders DNU for Y/SUB(DNU)/(X) and Y/SUB(DNU+1)/(X).
C         Forward recursion with the three term recursion relation
C         generates higher orders FNU+I-1, I=1,...,N.
C
C         To start the recursion FNU is normalized to the interval
C         -0.5.LE.DNU.LT.0.5. A special form of the power series is
C         implemented on 0.LT.X.LE.X1 while the Miller algorithm for the
C         K Bessel function in terms of the confluent hypergeometric
C         function U(FNU+0.5,2*FNU+1,I*X) is implemented on X1.LT.X.LE.X
C         Here I is the complex number SQRT(-1.).
C         For X.GT.X2, the asymptotic expansion for large X is used.
C         When FNU is a half odd integer, a special formula for
C         DNU=-0.5 and DNU+1.0=0.5 is used to start the recursion.
C
C         The maximum number of significant digits obtainable
C         is the smaller of 14 and the number of digits carried in
C         DOUBLE PRECISION arithmetic.
C
C         DBSYNU assumes that a significant digit SINH function is
C         available.
