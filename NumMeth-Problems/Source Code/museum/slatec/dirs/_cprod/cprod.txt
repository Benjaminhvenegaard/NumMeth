C***DESCRIPTION
C
C PROD applies a sequence of matrix operations to the vector X and
C stores the result in YY.   (COMPLEX case)
C AA         array containing scalar multipliers of the vector X.
C ND,NM1,NM2 are the lengths of the arrays BD,BM1,BM2 respectively.
C BD,BM1,BM2 are arrays containing roots of certain B polynomials.
C NA         is the length of the array AA.
C X,YY      The matrix operations are applied to X and the result is YY.
C A,B,C      are arrays which contain the tridiagonal matrix.
C M          is the order of the matrix.
C D,W,Y      are working arrays.
C ISGN       determines whether or not a change in sign is made.
