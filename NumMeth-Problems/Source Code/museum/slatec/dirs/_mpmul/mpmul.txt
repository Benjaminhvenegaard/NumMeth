C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  Multiplies X and Y, returning result in Z, for 'mp' X, Y and Z.
C  The simple o(t**2) algorithm is used, with four guard digits and
C  R*-rounding. Advantage is taken of zero digits in X, but not in Y.
C  Asymptotically faster algorithms are known (see Knuth, VOL. 2),
C  but are difficult to implement in FORTRAN in an efficient and
C  machine-independent manner. In comments to other 'mp' routines,
C  M(t) is the time to perform t-digit 'mp' multiplication. Thus
C  M(t) = o(t**2) with the present version of MPMUL, but
C  M(t) = o(t.log(t).log(log(t))) is theoretically possible.
C
C  The arguments X(*), Y(*), and Z(*), and the variable R in COMMON are
C  all INTEGER arrays of size 30.  See the comments in the routine
C  MPBLAS for the reason for this choice.
