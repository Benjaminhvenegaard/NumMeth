C***DESCRIPTION
C     DOUBLE PRECISION X
C     INTEGER IX
C
C                  CONVERTS (X,IX) = X*RADIX**IX
C                  TO DECIMAL FORM IN PREPARATION FOR
C                  PRINTING, SO THAT (X,IX) = X*10**IX
C                  WHERE 1/10 .LE. ABS(X) .LT. 1
C                  IS RETURNED, EXCEPT THAT IF
C                  (ABS(X),IX) IS BETWEEN RADIX**(-2L)
C                  AND RADIX**(2L) THEN THE REDUCED
C                  FORM WITH IX = 0 IS RETURNED.
