C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure TRBAK1,
C     NUM. MATH. 11, 181-195(1968) by Martin, Reinsch, and Wilkinson.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 212-226(1971).
C
C     This subroutine forms the eigenvectors of a REAL SYMMETRIC
C     matrix by back transforming those of the corresponding
C     symmetric tridiagonal matrix determined by  TRED1.
C
C     On Input
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional
C          array parameters, A and Z, as declared in the calling
C          program dimension statement.  NM is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix.  N is an INTEGER variable.
C          N must be less than or equal to NM.
C
C        A contains information about the orthogonal transformations
C          used in the reduction by  TRED1  in its strict lower
C          triangle.  A is a two-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned
C          A(NM,N).
C
C        E contains the subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix
C          in its last N-1 positions.  E(1) is arbitrary.  These
C          elements provide the remaining information about the
C          orthogonal transformations.  E is a one-dimensional REAL
C          array, dimensioned E(N).
C
C        M is the number of columns of Z to be back transformed.
C          M is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        Z contains the eigenvectors to be back transformed in its
C          first M columns.  Z is a two-dimensional REAL array,
C          dimensioned Z(NM,M).
C
C     On Output
C
C        Z contains the transformed eigenvectors in its first M columns.
C
C     Note that TRBAK1 preserves vector Euclidean norms.
