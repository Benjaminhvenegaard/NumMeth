C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     CUNK2 COMPUTES K(FNU,Z) AND ITS ANALYTIC CONTINUATION FROM THE
C     RIGHT HALF PLANE TO THE LEFT HALF PLANE BY MEANS OF THE
C     UNIFORM ASYMPTOTIC EXPANSIONS FOR H(KIND,FNU,ZN) AND J(FNU,ZN)
C     WHERE ZN IS IN THE RIGHT HALF PLANE, KIND=(3-MR)/2, MR=+1 OR
C     -1. HERE ZN=ZR*I OR -ZR*I WHERE ZR=Z IF Z IS IN THE RIGHT
C     HALF PLANE OR ZR=-Z IF Z IS IN THE LEFT HALF PLANE. MR INDIC-
C     ATES THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION FOR ANALYTIC CONTINUATION.
C     NZ=-1 MEANS AN OVERFLOW WILL OCCUR
