C***PURPOSE  Compute the Cholesky decomposition of a positive definite
C            matrix.  A pivoting option allows the user to estimate the
C            condition number of a positive definite matrix or determine
C            the rank of a positive semidefinite matrix.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     CCHDC computes the Cholesky decomposition of a positive definite
C     matrix.  A pivoting option allows the user to estimate the
C     condition of a positive definite matrix or determine the rank
C     of a positive semidefinite matrix.
C
C     On Entry
C
C         A      COMPLEX(LDA,P).
C                A contains the matrix whose decomposition is to
C                be computed.  Only the upper half of A need be stored.
C                The lower part of The array A is not referenced.
C
C         LDA    INTEGER.
C                LDA is the leading dimension of the array A.
C
C         P      INTEGER.
C                P is the order of the matrix.
C
C         WORK   COMPLEX.
C                WORK is a work array.
C
C         JPVT   INTEGER(P).
C                JPVT contains integers that control the selection
C                of the pivot elements, if pivoting has been requested.
C                Each diagonal element A(K,K)
C                is placed in one of three classes according to the
C                value of JPVT(K)).
C
C                   If JPVT(K)) .GT. 0, then X(K) is an initial
C                                      element.
C
C                   If JPVT(K)) .EQ. 0, then X(K) is a free element.
C
C                   If JPVT(K)) .LT. 0, then X(K) is a final element.
C
C                Before the decomposition is computed, initial elements
C                are moved by symmetric row and column interchanges to
C                the beginning of the array A and final
C                elements to the end.  Both initial and final elements
C                are frozen in place during the computation and only
C                free elements are moved.  At the K-th stage of the
C                reduction, if A(K,K) is occupied by a free element
C                it is interchanged with the largest free element
C                A(L,L) with L .GE. K.  JPVT is not referenced if
C                JOB .EQ. 0.
C
C        JOB     INTEGER.
C                JOB is an integer that initiates column pivoting.
C                IF JOB .EQ. 0, no pivoting is done.
C                IF JOB .NE. 0, pivoting is done.
C
C     On Return
C
C         A      A contains in its upper half the Cholesky factor
C                of the matrix A as it has been permuted by pivoting.
C
C         JPVT   JPVT(J) contains the index of the diagonal element
C                of A that was moved into the J-th position,
C                provided pivoting was requested.
C
C         INFO   contains the index of the last positive diagonal
C                element of the Cholesky factor.
C
C     For positive definite matrices INFO = P is the normal return.
C     For pivoting with positive semidefinite matrices INFO will
C     in general be less than P.  However, INFO may be greater than
C     the rank of A, since rounding error can cause an otherwise zero
C     element to be positive.  Indefinite systems will always cause
C     INFO to be less than P.
