C***DESCRIPTION
C
C         The following definitions are used in DBSKIN:
C
C     Definition 1
C         KI(0,X) = K-zero Bessel function.
C
C     Definition 2
C         KI(N,X) = Bickley Function
C                 =  integral from X to infinity of KI(N-1,t)dt
C                     for X .ge. 0 and N = 1,2,...
C  _____________________________________________________________________
C    DBSKIN computes a sequence of Bickley functions (repeated integrals
C    of the K0 Bessel function); i.e. for fixed X and N and for K=1,...,
C    DBSKIN computes the sequence
C
C                     Y(K) =         KI(N+K-1,X) for KODE=1
C          or
C                     Y(K) = EXP(X)*KI(N+K-1,X) for KODE=2,
C
C         for N.ge.0 and X.ge.0 (N and X cannot be zero simultaneously).
C
C      INPUT      X is DOUBLE PRECISION
C        X      - Argument, X .ge. 0.0D0
C        N      - Order of first member of the sequence N .ge. 0
C        KODE   - Selection parameter
C             KODE = 1 returns Y(K)=        KI(N+K-1,X), K=1,M
C                  = 2 returns Y(K)=EXP(X)*KI(N+K-1,X), K=1,M
C        M      - Number of members in the sequence, M.ge.1
C
C       OUTPUT     Y is a DOUBLE PRECISION VECTOR
C         Y      - A vector of dimension at least M containing the
C                  sequence selected by KODE.
C         NZ     - Underflow flag
C                  NZ = 0 means computation completed
C                     = 1 means an exponential underflow occurred on
C                         KODE=1.  Y(K)=0.0D0, K=1,...,M is returned
C                         KODE=1 AND Y(K)=0.0E0, K=1,...,M IS RETURNED
C         IERR   - Error flag
C                    IERR=0, Normal return, computation completed
C                    IERR=1, Input error,   no computation
C                    IERR=2, Error,         no computation
C                            Algorithm termination condition not met
C
C         The nominal computational accuracy is the maximum of unit
C         roundoff (=D1MACH(4)) and 1.0D-18 since critical constants
C         are given to only 18 digits.

C         BSKIN is the single precision version of DBSKIN.

C *Long Description:
C
C         Numerical recurrence on
C
C      (L-1)*KI(L,X) = X(KI(L-3,X) - KI(L-1,X)) + (L-2)*KI(L-2,X)
C
C         is stable where recurrence is carried forward or backward
C         away from INT(X+0.5).  The power series for indices 0,1 and 2
C         on 0.le.X.le.2 starts a stable recurrence for indices
C         greater than 2.  If N is sufficiently large (N.gt.NLIM), the
C         uniform asymptotic expansion for N to INFINITY is more
C         economical.  On X.gt.2 the recursion is started by evaluating
C         the uniform expansion for the three members whose indices are
C         closest to INT(X+0.5) within the set N,...,N+M-1.  Forward
C         recurrence, backward recurrence or both complete the
C         sequence depending on the relation of INT(X+0.5) to the
C         indices N,...,N+M-1.
