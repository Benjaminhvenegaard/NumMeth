C***AUTHOR  (UNKNOWN)
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  Called by MPADD, MPSUB etc.
C  X, Y and Z are MP numbers, Y1 and TRUNC are integers.
C  To force call by reference rather than value/result, Y1 is
C  declared as an array, but only Y1(1) is ever used.
C  Sets Z = X + Y1(1)*ABS(Y), where Y1(1) = +- Y(1).
C  If TRUNC .EQ. 0, R*-rounding is used;  otherwise, truncation.
C  R*-rounding is defined in the Kuki and Cody reference.
C
C  The arguments X(*), Y(*), and Z(*) are all INTEGER arrays of size
C  30.  See the comments in the routine MPBLAS for the reason for this
C  choice.
