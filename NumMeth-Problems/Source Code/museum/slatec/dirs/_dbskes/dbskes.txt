C***DESCRIPTION
C
C DBSKES(XNU,X,NIN,BKE) computes a double precision sequence
C of exponentially scaled modified Bessel functions
C of the third kind of order XNU + I at X, where X .GT. 0,
C XNU lies in (-1,1), and I = 0, 1, ... , NIN - 1, if NIN is positive
C and I = 0, -1, ... , NIN + 1, if NIN is negative.  On return, the
C vector BKE(.) contains the results at X for order starting at XNU.
C XNU, X, and BKE are double precision.  NIN is integer.
