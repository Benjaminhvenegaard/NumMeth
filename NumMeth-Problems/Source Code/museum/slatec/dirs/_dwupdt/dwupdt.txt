C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Given an N by N upper triangular matrix R, this subroutine
C     computes the QR decomposition of the matrix formed when a row
C     is added to R. If the row is specified by the vector W, then
C     DWUPDT determines an orthogonal matrix Q such that when the
C     N+1 by N matrix composed of R augmented by W is premultiplied
C     by (Q TRANSPOSE), the resulting matrix is upper trapezoidal.
C     The orthogonal matrix Q is the product of N transformations
C
C           G(1)*G(2)* ... *G(N)
C
C     where G(I) is a Givens rotation in the (I,N+1) plane which
C     eliminates elements in the I-th plane. DWUPDT also
C     computes the product (Q TRANSPOSE)*C where C is the
C     (N+1)-vector (b,alpha). Q itself is not accumulated, rather
C     the information to recover the G rotations is supplied.
C
C     The subroutine statement is
C
C       SUBROUTINE DWUPDT(N,R,LDR,W,B,ALPHA,COS,SIN)
C
C     where
C
C       N is a positive integer input variable set to the order of R.
C
C       R is an N by N array. On input the upper triangular part of
C         R must contain the matrix to be updated. On output R
C         contains the updated triangular matrix.
C
C       LDR is a positive integer input variable not less than N
C         which specifies the leading dimension of the array R.
C
C       W is an input array of length N which must contain the row
C         vector to be added to R.
C
C       B is an array of length N. On input B must contain the
C         first N elements of the vector C. On output B contains
C         the first N elements of the vector (Q TRANSPOSE)*C.
C
C       ALPHA is a variable. On input ALPHA must contain the
C         (N+1)-st element of the vector C. On output ALPHA contains
C         the (N+1)-st element of the vector (Q TRANSPOSE)*C.
C
C       COS is an output array of length N which contains the
C         cosines of the transforming Givens rotations.
C
C       SIN is an output array of length N which contains the
C         sines of the transforming Givens rotations.
