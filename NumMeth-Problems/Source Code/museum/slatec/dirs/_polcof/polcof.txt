C     Abstract
C        Subroutine POLCOF computes the coefficients of the polynomial
C     fit (including Hermite polynomial fits ) produced by a previous
C     call to POLINT. The coefficients of the polynomial, expanded about
C     XX, are stored in the array D. The expansion is of the form
C     P(Z) = D(1) + D(2)*(Z-XX) +D(3)*((Z-XX)**2) + ... +
C                                                  D(N)*((Z-XX)**(N-1)).
C     Between the call to POLINT and the call to POLCOF the variable N
C     and the arrays X and C must not be altered.
C
C     *****  INPUT PARAMETERS
C
C     XX   - The point about which the Taylor expansion is to be made.
C
C     N    - ****
C            *     N, X, and C must remain unchanged between the
C     X    - *     call to POLINT or the call to POLCOF.
C     C    - ****
C
C     *****  OUTPUT PARAMETER
C
C     D    - The array of coefficients for the Taylor expansion as
C            explained in the abstract
C
C     *****  STORAGE PARAMETER
C
C     WORK - This is an array to provide internal working storage. It
C            must be dimensioned by at least 2*N in the calling program.
C
C
C     **** Note - There are two methods for evaluating the fit produced
C     by POLINT. You may call POLYVL to perform the task, or you may
C     call POLCOF to obtain the coefficients of the Taylor expansion and
C     then write your own evaluation scheme. Due to the inherent errors
C     in the computations of the Taylor expansion from the Newton
C     coefficients produced by POLINT, much more accuracy may be
C     expected by calling POLYVL as opposed to writing your own scheme.
