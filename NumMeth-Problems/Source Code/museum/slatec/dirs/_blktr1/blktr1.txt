C***DESCRIPTION
C
C BLKTR1 solves the linear system set up by BLKTRI.
C
C B  contains the roots of all the B polynomials.
C W1,W2,W3,WD,WW,WU  are all working arrays.
C PRDCT  is either PRODP or PROD depending on whether the boundary
C conditions in the M direction are periodic or not.
C CPRDCT is either CPRODP or CPROD which are the complex versions
C of PRODP and PROD. These are called in the event that some
C of the roots of the B sub P polynomial are complex.
