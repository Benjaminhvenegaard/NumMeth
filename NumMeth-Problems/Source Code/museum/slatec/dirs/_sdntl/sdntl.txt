C***SUBSIDIARY
C***PURPOSE  Subroutine SDNTL is called to set parameters on the first
C            call to SDSTP, on an internal restart, or when the user has
C            altered MINT, MITER, and/or H.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  On the first call, the order is set to 1 and the initial derivatives
C  are calculated.  RMAX is the maximum ratio by which H can be
C  increased in one step.  It is initially RMINIT to compensate
C  for the small initial H, but then is normally equal to RMNORM.
C  If a failure occurs (in corrector convergence or error test), RMAX
C  is set at RMFAIL for the next increase.
C  If the caller has changed MINT, or if JTASK = 0, SDCST is called
C  to set the coefficients of the method.  If the caller has changed H,
C  YH must be rescaled.  If H or MINT has been changed, NWAIT is
C  reset to NQ + 2 to prevent further increases in H for that many
C  steps.  Also, RC is reset.  RC is the ratio of new to old values of
C  the coefficient L(0)*H.  If the caller has changed MITER, RC is
C  set to 0 to force the partials to be updated, if partials are used.
