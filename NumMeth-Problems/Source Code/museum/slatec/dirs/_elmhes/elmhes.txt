C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure ELMHES,
C     NUM. MATH. 12, 349-368(1968) by Martin and Wilkinson.

C
C     Given a REAL GENERAL matrix, this subroutine
C     reduces a submatrix situated in rows and columns
C     LOW through IGH to upper Hessenberg form by
C     stabilized elementary similarity transformations.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional
C          array parameter, A, as declared in the calling program
C          dimension statement.  NM is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix, A.  N is an INTEGER variable.
C          N must be less than or equal to NM.
C
C        LOW and IGH are two INTEGER variables determined by the
C          balancing subroutine  BALANC.  If  BALANC  has not been
C          used, set LOW=1 and IGH equal to the order of the matrix, N.
C
C        A contains the input matrix.  A is a two-dimensional REAL
C          array, dimensioned A(NM,N).
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        A contains the upper Hessenberg matrix.  The multipliers which
C          were used in the reduction are stored in the remaining
C          triangle under the Hessenberg matrix.
C
C        INT contains information on the rows and columns interchanged
C          in the reduction.  Only elements LOW through IGH are used.
C          INT is a one-dimensional INTEGER array, dimensioned INT(IGH).
