C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     For a rank deficient problem, additional orthogonal
C     HOUSEHOLDER transformations are applied to the left side
C     of Q to further reduce the triangular form.
C     Thus, after application of the routines ORTHOR and OHTROL
C     to the original matrix, the result is a nonsingular
C     triangular matrix while the remainder of the matrix
C     has been zeroed out.
