C***BEGIN PROLOGUE  DXPMUP
C***SUBSIDIARY
C***PURPOSE  To compute the values of Legendre functions for DXLEGF.
C            This subroutine transforms an array of Legendre functions
C            of the first kind of negative order stored in array PQA
C            into Legendre functions of the first kind of positive
C            order stored in array PQA. The original array is destroyed.
