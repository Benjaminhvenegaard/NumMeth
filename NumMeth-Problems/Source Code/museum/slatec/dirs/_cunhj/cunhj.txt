C     ABSTRACT
C         CUNHJ COMPUTES PARAMETERS FOR BESSEL FUNCTIONS C(FNU,Z) =
C         J(FNU,Z), Y(FNU,Z) OR H(I,FNU,Z) I=1,2 FOR LARGE ORDERS FNU
C         BY MEANS OF THE UNIFORM ASYMPTOTIC EXPANSION
C
C         C(FNU,Z)=C1*PHI*( ASUM*AIRY(ARG) + C2*BSUM*DAIRY(ARG) )
C
C         FOR PROPER CHOICES OF C1, C2, AIRY AND DAIRY WHERE AIRY IS
C         AN AIRY FUNCTION AND DAIRY IS ITS DERIVATIVE.
C
C               (2/3)*FNU*ZETA**1.5 = ZETA1-ZETA2,
C
C         ZETA1=0.5*FNU*CLOG((1+W)/(1-W)), ZETA2=FNU*W FOR SCALING
C         PURPOSES IN AIRY FUNCTIONS FROM CAIRY OR CBIRY.
C
C         MCONJ=SIGN OF AIMAG(Z), BUT IS AMBIGUOUS WHEN Z IS REAL AND
C         MUST BE SPECIFIED. IPMTR=0 RETURNS ALL PARAMETERS. IPMTR=
C         1 COMPUTES ALL EXCEPT ASUM AND BSUM.
