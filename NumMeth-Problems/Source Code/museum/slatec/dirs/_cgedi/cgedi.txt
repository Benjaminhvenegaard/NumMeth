C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     CGEDI computes the determinant and inverse of a matrix
C     using the factors computed by CGECO or CGEFA.
C
C     On Entry
C
C        A       COMPLEX(LDA, N)
C                the output from CGECO or CGEFA.
C
C        LDA     INTEGER
C                the leading dimension of the array  A .
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the matrix  A .
C
C        IPVT    INTEGER(N)
C                the pivot vector from CGECO or CGEFA.
C
C        WORK    COMPLEX(N)
C                work vector.  Contents destroyed.
C
C        JOB     INTEGER
C                = 11   both determinant and inverse.
C                = 01   inverse only.
C                = 10   determinant only.
C
C     On Return
C
C        A       inverse of original matrix if requested.
C                Otherwise unchanged.
C
C        DET     COMPLEX(2)
C                determinant of original matrix if requested.
C                Otherwise not referenced.
C                Determinant = DET(1) * 10.0**DET(2)
C                with  1.0 .LE. CABS1(DET(1)) .LT. 10.0
C                or  DET(1) .EQ. 0.0 .
C
C     Error Condition
C
C        A division by zero will occur if the input factor contains
C        a zero on the diagonal and the inverse is requested.
C        It will not occur if the subroutines are called correctly
C        and if CGECO has set RCOND .GT. 0.0 or CGEFA has set
C        INFO .EQ. 0 .
