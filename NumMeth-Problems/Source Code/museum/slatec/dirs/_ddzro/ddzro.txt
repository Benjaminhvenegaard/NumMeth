C***PURPOSE  DDZRO searches for a zero of a function F(N, T, Y, IROOT)
C            between the given values B and C until the width of the
C            interval (B, C) has collapsed to within a tolerance
C            specified by the stopping criterion,

C     PARAMETERS
C        F     - Name of the external function, which returns a
C                double precision result.  This name must be in an
C                EXTERNAL statement in the calling program.
C        B     - One end of the interval (B, C).  The value returned for
C                B usually is the better approximation to a zero of F.
C        C     - The other end of the interval (B, C).
C        RE    - Relative error used for RW in the stopping criterion.
C                If the requested RE is less than machine precision,
C                then RW is set to approximately machine precision.
C        AE    - Absolute error used in the stopping criterion.  If the
C                given interval (B, C) contains the origin, then a
C                nonzero value should be chosen for AE.
