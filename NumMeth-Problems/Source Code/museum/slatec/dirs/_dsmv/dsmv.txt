C***DESCRIPTION
C
C *Usage:
C     INTEGER  N, NELT, IA(NELT), JA(NELT), ISYM
C     DOUBLE PRECISION X(N), Y(N), A(NELT)
C
C     CALL DSMV(N, X, Y, NELT, IA, JA, A, ISYM )
C
C *Arguments:
C N      :IN       Integer.
C         Order of the Matrix.
C X      :IN       Double Precision X(N).
C         The vector that should be multiplied by the matrix.
C Y      :OUT      Double Precision Y(N).
C         The product of the matrix and the vector.
C NELT   :IN       Integer.
C         Number of Non-Zeros stored in A.
C IA     :IN       Integer IA(NELT).
C JA     :IN       Integer JA(NELT).
C A      :IN       Double Precision A(NELT).
C         These arrays should hold the matrix A in the SLAP Column
C         format.  See "Description", below.
C ISYM   :IN       Integer.
C         Flag to indicate symmetric storage format.
C         If ISYM=0, all non-zero entries of the matrix are stored.
C         If ISYM=1, the matrix is symmetric, and only the upper
C         or lower triangle of the matrix is stored.

C *Description
C       =================== S L A P Column format ==================
C       This routine  requires that  the matrix A  be stored in  the
C       SLAP Column format.  In this format the non-zeros are stored
C       counting down columns (except for  the diagonal entry, which
C       must appear first in each  "column")  and are stored  in the
C       double precision array A.   In other words,  for each column
C       in the matrix put the diagonal entry in  A.  Then put in the
C       other non-zero  elements going down  the column (except  the
C       diagonal) in order.   The  IA array holds the  row index for
C       each non-zero.  The JA array holds the offsets  into the IA,
C       A arrays  for  the  beginning  of each   column.   That  is,
C       IA(JA(ICOL)),  A(JA(ICOL)) points   to the beginning  of the
C       ICOL-th   column    in    IA and   A.      IA(JA(ICOL+1)-1),
C       A(JA(ICOL+1)-1) points to  the  end of the   ICOL-th column.
C       Note that we always have  JA(N+1) = NELT+1,  where N is  the
C       number of columns in  the matrix and NELT  is the number  of
C       non-zeros in the matrix.
C
C       Here is an example of the  SLAP Column  storage format for a
C       5x5 Matrix (in the A and IA arrays '|'  denotes the end of a
C       column):

C       |11 12  0  0 15|   A: 11 21 51 | 22 12 | 33 53 | 44 | 55 15 35
C       |21 22  0  0  0|  IA:  1  2  5 |  2  1 |  3  5 |  4 |  5  1  3
C       | 0  0 33  0 35|  JA:  1  4  6    8  9   12
C       | 0  0  0 44  0|
C       |51  0 53  0 55|
C
C       With  the SLAP  format  the "inner  loops" of  this  routine
C       should vectorize   on machines with   hardware  support  for
C       vector gather/scatter operations.  Your compiler may require
C       a  compiler directive  to  convince   it that there  are  no
C       implicit vector  dependencies.  Compiler directives  for the
C       Alliant FX/Fortran and CRI CFT/CFT77 compilers  are supplied
C       with the standard SLAP distribution.
C
C *Cautions:
C     This   routine   assumes  that  the matrix A is stored in SLAP
C     Column format.  It does not check  for  this (for  speed)  and
C     evil, ugly, ornery and nasty things  will happen if the matrix
C     data  structure  is,  in fact, not SLAP Column.  Beware of the
C     wrong data structure!!!
