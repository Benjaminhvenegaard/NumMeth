C***DESCRIPTION

C     Abstract
C        XSETUA may be called to declare a list of up to five
C        logical units, each of which is to receive a copy of
C        each error message processed by this package.
C        The purpose of XSETUA is to allow simultaneous printing
C        of each error message on, say, a main output file,
C        an interactive terminal, and other files such as graphics
C        communication files.
