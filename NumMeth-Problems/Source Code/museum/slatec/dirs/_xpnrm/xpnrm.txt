C***BEGIN PROLOGUE  XPNRM
C***SUBSIDIARY
C***PURPOSE  To compute the values of Legendre functions for XLEGF.
C            This subroutine transforms an array of Legendre functions
C            of the first kind of negative order stored in array PQA
C            into normalized Legendre polynomials stored in array PQA.
C            The original array is destroyed.
