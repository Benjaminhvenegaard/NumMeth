C *Description:
C
C     The definition and properties of 6j symbols can be found, for
C  example, in Appendix C of Volume II of A. Messiah. Although the
C  parameters of the vector addition coefficients satisfy certain
C  conventional restrictions, the restriction that they be non-negative
C  integers or non-negative integers plus 1/2 is not imposed on input
C  to this subroutine. The restrictions imposed are
C       1. L2+L3+L5+L6 and L2+L4+L6 must be integers;
C       2. ABS(L2-L4).LE.L6.LE.L2+L4 must be satisfied;
C       3. ABS(L4-L5).LE.L3.LE.L4+L5 must be satisfied;
C       4. L1MAX-L1MIN must be a non-negative integer, where
C          L1MAX=MIN(L2+L3,L5+L6) and L1MIN=MAX(ABS(L2-L3),ABS(L5-L6)).
C  If all the conventional restrictions are satisfied, then these
C  restrictions are met. Conversely, if input to this subroutine meets
C  all of these restrictions and the conventional restriction stated
C  above, then all the conventional restrictions are satisfied.
C
C     The user should be cautious in using input parameters that do
C  not satisfy the conventional restrictions. For example, the
C  the subroutine produces values of
C       h(L1) = { L1 2/3  1 }
C               {2/3 2/3 2/3}
C  for L1=1/3 and 4/3 but none of the symmetry properties of the 6j
C  symbol, set forth on pages 1063 and 1064 of Messiah, is satisfied.
C
C     The subroutine generates h(L1MIN), h(L1MIN+1), ..., h(L1MAX)
C  where L1MIN and L1MAX are defined above. The sequence h(L1) is
C  generated by a three-term recurrence algorithm with scaling to
C  control overflow. Both backward and forward recurrence are used to
C  maintain numerical stability. The two recurrence sequences are
C  matched at an interior point and are normalized from the unitary
C  property of 6j coefficients and Wigner's phase convention.
C
C    The algorithm is suited to applications in which large quantum
C  numbers arise, such as in molecular dynamics.

C   750101  DATE WRITTEN
C   880515  SLATEC prologue added by G. C. Nielson, NBS; parameters
C           HUGE and TINY revised to depend on D1MACH.
C   891229  Prologue description rewritten; other prologue sections
C           revised; LMATCH (location of match point for recurrences)
C           removed from argument list; argument IER changed to serve
C           only as an error flag (previously, in cases without error,
C           it returned the number of scalings); number of error codes
C           increased to provide more precise error information;
C           program comments revised; SLATEC error handler calls
C           introduced to enable printing of error messages to meet
C           SLATEC standards. These changes were done by D. W. Lozier,

C           of Standards and Technology, formerly NBS.
C   910415  Mixed type expressions eliminated; variable C1 initialized;
C           description of SIXCOF expanded. These changes were done by
C           D. W. Lozier.
