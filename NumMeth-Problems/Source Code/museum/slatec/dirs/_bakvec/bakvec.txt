C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine forms the eigenvectors of a NONSYMMETRIC
C     TRIDIAGONAL matrix by back transforming those of the
C     corresponding symmetric matrix determined by  FIGI.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional
C          array parameters, T and Z, as declared in the calling
C          program dimension statement.  NM is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix T.  N is an INTEGER variable.
C          N must be less than or equal to NM.
C
C        T contains the nonsymmetric matrix.  Its subdiagonal is
C          stored in the last N-1 positions of the first column,
C          its diagonal in the N positions of the second column,
C          and its superdiagonal in the first N-1 positions of
C          the third column.  T(1,1) and T(N,3) are arbitrary.
C          T is a two-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned T(NM,3).
C
C        E contains the subdiagonal elements of the symmetric
C          matrix in its last N-1 positions.  E(1) is arbitrary.
C          E is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned E(N).
C
C        M is the number of eigenvectors to be back transformed.
C          M is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        Z contains the eigenvectors to be back transformed
C          in its first M columns.  Z is a two-dimensional REAL
C          array, dimensioned Z(NM,M).
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        T is unaltered.
C
C        E is destroyed.
C
C        Z contains the transformed eigenvectors in its first M columns.
C
C        IERR is an INTEGER flag set to
C          Zero       for normal return,
C          2*N+I      if E(I) is zero with T(I,1) or T(I-1,3) non-zero.
C                     In this case, the symmetric matrix is not similar
C                     to the original matrix, and the eigenvectors
C                     cannot be found by this program.
