C***DESCRIPTION
C
C         HPPERM rearranges the data vector HX according to the
C         permutation IPERM: HX(I) <--- HX(IPERM(I)).  IPERM could come
C         from one of the sorting routines IPSORT, SPSORT, DPSORT or
C         HPSORT.

C     Description of Parameters
C         HX - input/output -- character array of values to be
C                 rearranged.
C         N - input -- number of values in character array HX.
C         IPERM - input -- permutation vector.
C         WORK - character variable which must have a length
C                   specification at least as great as that of HX.
C         IER - output -- error indicator:
C             =  0  if no error,
C             =  1  if N is zero or negative,
C             =  2  if work array is not long enough,
C             =  3  if IPERM is not a valid permutation.
