C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine finds those eigenvalues of a TRIDIAGONAL
C     SYMMETRIC matrix which lie in a specified interval and their
C     associated eigenvectors, using bisection and inverse iteration.
C
C     On Input
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional
C          array parameter, Z, as declared in the calling program
C          dimension statement.  NM is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix.  N is an INTEGER variable.
C          N must be less than or equal to NM.
C
C        EPS1 is an absolute error tolerance for the computed eigen-
C          values.  It should be chosen so that the accuracy of these
C          eigenvalues is commensurate with relative perturbations of
C          the order of the relative machine precision in the matrix
C          elements.  If the input EPS1 is non-positive, it is reset
C          for each submatrix to a default value, namely, minus the
C          product of the relative machine precision and the 1-norm of
C          the submatrix.  EPS1 is a REAL variable.
C
C        D contains the diagonal elements of the symmetric tridiagonal
C          matrix.  D is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned D(N).
C
C        E contains the subdiagonal elements of the symmetric
C          tridiagonal matrix in its last N-1 positions.  E(1) is
C          arbitrary.  E is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned
C          E(N).
C
C        E2 contains the squares of the corresponding elements of E.
C          E2(1) is arbitrary.  E2 is a one-dimensional REAL array,
C          dimensioned E2(N).
C
C        LB and UB define the interval to be searched for eigenvalues.
C          If LB is not less than UB, no eigenvalues will be found.
C          LB and UB are REAL variables.
C
C        MM should be set to an upper bound for the number of
C          eigenvalues in the interval.  MM is an INTEGER variable.
C          WARNING -  If more than MM eigenvalues are determined to lie
C          in the interval, an error return is made with no values or
C          vectors found.
C
C     On Output
C
C        EPS1 is unaltered unless it has been reset to its
C          (last) default value.
C
C        D and E are unaltered.
C
C        Elements of E2, corresponding to elements of E regarded as
C          negligible, have been replaced by zero causing the matrix to
C          split into a direct sum of submatrices.  E2(1) is also set
C          to zero.
C
C        M is the number of eigenvalues determined to lie in (LB,UB).
C          M is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        W contains the M eigenvalues in ascending order if the matrix
C          does not split.  If the matrix splits, the eigenvalues are
C          in ascending order for each submatrix.  If a vector error
C          exit is made, W contains those values already found.  W is a
C          one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned W(MM).
C
C        Z contains the associated set of orthonormal eigenvectors.
C          If an error exit is made, Z contains those vectors already
C          found.  Z is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned
C          Z(NM,MM).
C
C        IERR is an INTEGER flag set to
C          Zero       for normal return,
C          3*N+1      if M exceeds MM no eigenvalues or eigenvectors
C                     are computed,
C          4*N+J      if the eigenvector corresponding to the J-th
C                     eigenvalue fails to converge in 5 iterations, then
C                     the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in W and Z should
C                     be correct for indices 1, 2, ..., J-1.
C
C        RV1, RV2, RV3, RV4, RV5, and RV6 are temporary storage arrays,
C          dimensioned RV1(N), RV2(N), RV3(N), RV4(N), RV5(N), and
C          RV6(N).
