C                       Function subroutine defining the integrand
C                       function F(X). The actual name for F needs to be
C                       declared E X T E R N A L in the calling program.
C
C              A      - Real

C                       of abscissae to the 25-point Gauss rule (RESG).
C
C              ABSERR - Real
C                       Estimate of the modulus of the absolute error,
C                       which should not exceed ABS(I-RESULT)
C
C              RESABS - Real
C                       Approximation to the integral J
C
C              RESASC - Real
