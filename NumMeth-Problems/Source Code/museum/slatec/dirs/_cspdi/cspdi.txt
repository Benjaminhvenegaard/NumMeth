C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     CSPDI computes the determinant and inverse
C     of a complex symmetric matrix using the factors from CSPFA,
C     where the matrix is stored in packed form.
C
C     On Entry
C
C        AP      COMPLEX (N*(N+1)/2)
C                the output from CSPFA.
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the matrix A .
C
C        KVPT    INTEGER(N)
C                the pivot vector from CSPFA.
C
C        WORK    COMPLEX(N)
C                work vector.  Contents ignored.
C
C        JOB     INTEGER
C                JOB has the decimal expansion  AB  where
C                   if  B .NE. 0, the inverse is computed,
C                   if  A .NE. 0, the determinant is computed.
C
C                For example, JOB = 11  gives both.
C
C     On Return
C
C        Variables not requested by JOB are not used.
C
C        AP     contains the upper triangle of the inverse of
C               the original matrix, stored in packed form.
C               The columns of the upper triangle are stored
C               sequentially in a one-dimensional array.
C
C        DET    COMPLEX(2)
C               determinant of original matrix.
C               Determinant = DET(1) * 10.0**DET(2)
C               with 1.0 .LE. ABS(DET(1)) .LT. 10.0
C               or DET(1) = 0.0.
C
C     Error Condition
C
C        A division by zero will occur if the inverse is requested
C        and  CSPCO  has set RCOND .EQ. 0.0
C        or  CSPFA  has set  INFO .NE. 0 .
