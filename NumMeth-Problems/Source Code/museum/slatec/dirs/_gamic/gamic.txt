C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   Evaluate the complementary incomplete gamma function
C
C   GAMIC = integral from X to infinity of EXP(-T) * T**(A-1.)  .
C
C   GAMIC is evaluated for arbitrary real values of A and for non-
C   negative values of X (even though GAMIC is defined for X .LT.
C   0.0), except that for X = 0 and A .LE. 0.0, GAMIC is undefined.
C
C   GAMIC, A, and X are REAL.
C
C   A slight deterioration of 2 or 3 digits accuracy will occur when
C   GAMIC is very large or very small in absolute value, because log-
C   arithmic variables are used.  Also, if the parameter A is very close
C   to a negative integer (but not a negative integer), there is a loss
C   of accuracy, which is reported if the result is less than half
C   machine precision.
