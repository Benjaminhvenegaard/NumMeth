C***DESCRIPTION
C
C CLNREL(Z) = LOG(1+Z) with relative error accuracy near Z = 0.
C Let   RHO = ABS(Z)  and
C       R**2 = ABS(1+Z)**2 = (1+X)**2 + Y**2 = 1 + 2*X + RHO**2 .
C Now if RHO is small we may evaluate CLNREL(Z) accurately by
C       LOG(1+Z) = CMPLX  (LOG(R), CARG(1+Z))
C                 = CMPLX  (0.5*LOG(R**2), CARG(1+Z))
C                 = CMPLX  (0.5*ALNREL(2*X+RHO**2), CARG(1+Z))
