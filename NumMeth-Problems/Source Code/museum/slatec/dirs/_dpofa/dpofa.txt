C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     DPOFA factors a double precision symmetric positive definite
C     matrix.
C
C     DPOFA is usually called by DPOCO, but it can be called
C     directly with a saving in time if  RCOND  is not needed.
C     (time for DPOCO) = (1 + 18/N)*(time for DPOFA) .
C
C     On Entry
C
C        A       DOUBLE PRECISION(LDA, N)
C                the symmetric matrix to be factored.  Only the
C                diagonal and upper triangle are used.
C
C        LDA     INTEGER
C                the leading dimension of the array  A .
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the matrix  A .
C
C     On Return
C
C        A       an upper triangular matrix  R  so that  A = TRANS(R)*R
C                where  TRANS(R)  is the transpose.
C                The strict lower triangle is unaltered.
C                If  INFO .NE. 0 , the factorization is not complete.
C
C        INFO    INTEGER
C                = 0  for normal return.
C                = K  signals an error condition.  The leading minor
C                     of order  K  is not positive definite.
