C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     LSSODS solves the same problem as SODS (in fact, it is called by
C     SODS) but is somewhat more flexible in its use. In particular,
C     LSSODS allows for iterative refinement of the solution, makes the
C     transformation and triangular reduction information more
C     accessible, and enables the user to avoid destruction of the
C     original matrix A.
C
C     Modeled after the ALGOL codes in the articles in the REFERENCES
C     section.

C   INPUT
C **********************************************************************
C
C     A -- Contains the matrix of M equations in N unknowns and must
C          be dimensioned NRDA by N. A remains unchanged
C     X -- Solution array of length at least N
C     B -- Given constant vector of length M, B remains unchanged
C     M -- Number of equations, M greater or equal to 1
C     N -- Number of unknowns, N not larger than M
C  NRDA -- Row dimension of A, NRDA greater or equal to M
C IFLAG -- Status indicator
C         = 0 for the first call (and for each new problem defined by
C             a new matrix A) when the matrix data is treated as exact
C         =-K for the first call (and for each new problem defined by
C             a new matrix A) when the matrix data is assumed to be
C             accurate to about K digits
C         = 1 for subsequent calls whenever the matrix A has already
C             been decomposed (problems with new vectors B but
C             same matrix a can be handled efficiently)
C ISCALE -- Scaling indicator
C         =-1 if the matrix A is to be pre-scaled by
C             columns when appropriate
C             If the scaling indicator is not equal to -1
C             no scaling will be attempted
C             For most problems scaling will probably not be necessary
C   ITER -- Maximum number of iterative improvement steps to be
C           performed,  0 .LE. ITER .LE. 10   (SODS uses ITER=0)
C      Q -- Matrix used for the transformation, must be dimensioned
C           NRDA by N  (SODS puts A in the Q location which conserves
C           storage but destroys A)
C           When iterative improvement of the solution is requested,
C           ITER .GT. 0, this additional storage for Q must be
C           made available
C DIAG,KPIVOT,Z,R, -- Arrays of length N (except for R which is M)
C   DIV,TD,SCALES     used for internal storage

C   OUTPUT
C **********************************************************************
C
C  IFLAG -- Status indicator
C            =1 if solution was obtained
C            =2 if improper input is detected
C            =3 if rank of matrix is less than N
C               if the minimal length least squares solution is
C               desired, simply reset IFLAG=1 and call the code again
C
C       The next three IFLAG values can occur only when
C        the iterative improvement mode is being used.
C            =4 if the problem is ill-conditioned and maximal
C               machine accuracy is not achievable
C            =5 if the problem is very ill-conditioned and the solution
C               IS likely to have no correct digits
C            =6 if the allowable number of iterative improvement steps
C               has been completed without getting convergence
C      X -- Least squares solution of  A X = B
C  IRANK -- Contains the numerically determined matrix rank
C           the user must not alter this value on succeeding calls
C           with input values of IFLAG=1
C      Q -- Contains the strictly upper triangular part of the reduced
C           matrix and the transformation information in the lower
C           triangular part
C   DIAG -- Contains the diagonal elements of the triangular reduced
C           matrix
C KPIVOT -- Contains the pivotal information.  The column interchanges
C           performed on the original matrix are recorded here
C   ITER -- The actual number of iterative corrections used
C RESNRM -- The Euclidean norm of the residual vector  B - A X
C  XNORM -- The Euclidean norm of the solution vector
C DIV,TD -- Contains transformation information for rank
C           deficient problems
C SCALES -- Contains the column scaling parameters
