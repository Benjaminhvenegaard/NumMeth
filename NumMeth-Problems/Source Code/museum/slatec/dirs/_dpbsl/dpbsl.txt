C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     DPBSL solves the double precision symmetric positive definite
C     band system  A*X = B
C     using the factors computed by DPBCO or DPBFA.
C
C     On Entry
C
C        ABD     DOUBLE PRECISION(LDA, N)
C                the output from DPBCO or DPBFA.
C
C        LDA     INTEGER
C                the leading dimension of the array  ABD .
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the matrix  A .
C
C        M       INTEGER
C                the number of diagonals above the main diagonal.
C
C        B       DOUBLE PRECISION(N)
C                the right hand side vector.
C
C     On Return
C
C        B       the solution vector  X .
C
C     Error Condition
C
C        A division by zero will occur if the input factor contains
C        a zero on the diagonal.  Technically this indicates
C        singularity, but it is usually caused by improper subroutine
C        arguments.  It will not occur if the subroutines are called
C        correctly, and  INFO .EQ. 0 .
C
C     To compute  INVERSE(A) * C  where  C  is a matrix
C     with  P  columns
C           CALL DPBCO(ABD,LDA,N,RCOND,Z,INFO)
C           IF (RCOND is too small .OR. INFO .NE. 0) GO TO ...
C           DO 10 J = 1, P
C              CALL DPBSL(ABD,LDA,N,C(1,J))
C        10 CONTINUE
