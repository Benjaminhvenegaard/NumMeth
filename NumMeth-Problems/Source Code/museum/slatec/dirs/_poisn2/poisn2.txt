C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Subroutine to solve Poisson's equation with Neumann boundary
C     conditions.
C
C     ISTAG = 1 if the last diagonal block is A.
C     ISTAG = 2 if the last diagonal block is A-I.
C     MIXBND = 1 if have Neumann boundary conditions at both boundaries.
C     MIXBND = 2 if have Neumann boundary conditions at bottom and
C     Dirichlet condition at top.  (for this case, must have ISTAG = 1.)
