C***DESCRIPTION
C     REAL X
C     INTEGER IX
C
C                  TRANSFORMS (X,IX) SO THAT
C                  RADIX**(-L) .LE. ABS(X) .LT. RADIX**L.
C                  ON MOST COMPUTERS THIS TRANSFORMATION DOES
C                  NOT CHANGE THE MANTISSA OF X PROVIDED RADIX IS
C                  THE NUMBER BASE OF SINGLE-PRECISION ARITHMETIC.
