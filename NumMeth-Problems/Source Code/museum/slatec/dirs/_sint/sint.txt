C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  Subroutine SINT computes the discrete Fourier sine transform
C  of an odd sequence X(I).  The transform is defined below at
C  output parameter X.
C
C  SINT is the unnormalized inverse of itself since a call of SINT
C  followed by another call of SINT will multiply the input sequence
C  X by 2*(N+1).
C
C  The array WSAVE which is used by subroutine SINT must be
C  initialized by calling subroutine SINTI(N,WSAVE).
C
C  Input Parameters
C
C  N       the length of the sequence to be transformed.  The method
C          is most efficient when N+1 is the product of small primes.
C
C  X       an array which contains the sequence to be transformed
C
C
C  WSAVE   a work array with dimension at least INT(3.5*N+16)
C          in the program that calls SINT.  The WSAVE array must be
C          initialized by calling subroutine SINTI(N,WSAVE), and a
C          different WSAVE array must be used for each different
C          value of N.  This initialization does not have to be
C          repeated so long as N remains unchanged.  Thus subsequent
C          transforms can be obtained faster than the first.
C
C  Output Parameters
C
C  X       For I=1,...,N
C
C               X(I)= the sum from K=1 to K=N
C
C                    2*X(K)*SIN(K*I*PI/(N+1))
C
C               A call of SINT followed by another call of
C               SINT will multiply the sequence X by 2*(N+1).
C               Hence SINT is the unnormalized inverse
C               of itself.
C
C  WSAVE   contains initialization calculations which must not be
C          destroyed between calls of SINT.
