C     Abstract
C         BSPVN is the BSPLVN routine of the reference.
C
C         BSPVN calculates the value of all (possibly) nonzero basis
C         functions at X of order MAX(JHIGH,(J+1)*(INDEX-1)), where
C         T(K) .LE. X .LE. T(N+1) and J=IWORK is set inside the routine
C         on the first call when INDEX=1.  ILEFT is such that T(ILEFT)
C         .LE. X .LT. T(ILEFT+1).  A call to INTRV(T,N+1,X,ILO,ILEFT,
C         MFLAG) produces the proper ILEFT.  BSPVN calculates using the
C         basic algorithm needed in BSPVD.  If only basis functions are
C         desired, setting JHIGH=K and INDEX=1 can be faster than
C         calling BSPVD, but extra coding is required for derivatives
C         (INDEX=2) and BSPVD is set up for this purpose.
C
C         Left limiting values are set up as described in BSPVD.
C
C     Description of Arguments
C         Input
C          T       - knot vector of length N+K, where
C                    N = number of B-spline basis functions
C                    N = sum of knot multiplicities-K
C          JHIGH   - order of B-spline, 1 .LE. JHIGH .LE. K
C          K       - highest possible order
C          INDEX   - INDEX = 1 gives basis functions of order JHIGH
C                          = 2 denotes previous entry with WORK, IWORK
C                              values saved for subsequent calls to
C                              BSPVN.
C          X       - argument of basis functions,
C                    T(K) .LE. X .LE. T(N+1)
C          ILEFT   - largest integer such that
C                    T(ILEFT) .LE. X .LT. T(ILEFT+1)
C
C         Output
C          VNIKX   - vector of length K for spline values.
C          WORK    - a work vector of length 2*K
C          IWORK   - a work parameter.  Both WORK and IWORK contain
C                    information necessary to continue for INDEX = 2.
C                    When INDEX = 1 exclusively, these are scratch
C                    variables and can be used for other purposes.
C
C     Error Conditions
C         Improper input is a fatal error.
