C***PURPOSE  Sort an array and optionally make the same interchanges in
C            an auxiliary array.  The array may be sorted in increasing
C            or decreasing order.  A slightly modified QUICKSORT
C            algorithm is used.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   ISORT sorts array IX and optionally makes the same interchanges in
C   array IY.  The array IX may be sorted in increasing order or
C   decreasing order.  A slightly modified quicksort algorithm is used.
C
C   Description of Parameters
C      IX - integer array of values to be sorted
C      IY - integer array to be (optionally) carried along
C      N  - number of values in integer array IX to be sorted
C      KFLAG - control parameter
C            =  2  means sort IX in increasing order and carry IY along.
C            =  1  means sort IX in increasing order (ignoring IY)
C            = -1  means sort IX in decreasing order (ignoring IY)
C            = -2  means sort IX in decreasing order and carry IY along.
