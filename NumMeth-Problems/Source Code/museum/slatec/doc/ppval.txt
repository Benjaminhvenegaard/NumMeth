C     Abstract
C         PPVAL is the PPVALU function of the reference.
C
C         PPVAL calculates (at X) the value of the IDERIV-th
C         derivative of the B-spline from the PP-representation
C         (C,XI,LXI,K).  The Taylor expansion about XI(J) for X in
C         the interval XI(J) .LE. X .LT. XI(J+1) is evaluated, J=1,LXI.
C         Right limiting values at X=XI(J) are obtained.  PPVAL will
C         extrapolate beyond XI(1) and XI(LXI+1).
C
C         To obtain left limiting values (left derivatives) at XI(J),
C         replace LXI by J-1 and set X=XI(J),J=2,LXI+1.

C     Description of Arguments
C         Input
C          LDC     - leading dimension of C matrix, LDC .GE. K
C          C       - matrix of dimension at least (K,LXI) containing
C                    right derivatives at break points XI(*).
C          XI      - break point vector of length LXI+1
C          LXI     - number of polynomial pieces
C          K       - order of B-spline, K .GE. 1
C          IDERIV  - order of the derivative, 0 .LE. IDERIV .LE. K-1
C                    IDERIV=0 gives the B-spline value
C          X       - argument, XI(1) .LE. X .LE. XI(LXI+1)
C          INPPV   - an initialization parameter which must be set
C                    to 1 the first time PPVAL is called.
C
C         Output
C          INPPV   - INPPV contains information for efficient process-
C                    ing after the initial call and INPPV must not
C                    be changed by the user.  Distinct splines require
C                    distinct INPPV parameters.
C          PPVAL   - value of the IDERIV-th derivative at X
C
C     Error Conditions
C         Improper input is a fatal error
