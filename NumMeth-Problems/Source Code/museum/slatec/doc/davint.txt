C     Abstract
C         DAVINT integrates a function tabulated at arbitrarily spaced
C         abscissas.  The limits of integration need not coincide
C         with the tabulated abscissas.
C
C         A method of overlapping parabolas fitted to the data is used
C         provided that there are at least 3 abscissas between the
C         limits of integration.  DAVINT also handles two special cases.
C         If the limits of integration are equal, DAVINT returns a
C         result of zero regardless of the number of tabulated values.
C         If there are only two function values, DAVINT uses the
C         trapezoid rule.

C     Description of Parameters
C         The user must dimension all arrays appearing in the call list
C              X(N), Y(N)
C
C         Input--
C      X    - DOUBLE PRECISION array of abscissas, which must be in
C             increasing order.
C      Y    - DOUBLE PRECISION array of function values. i.e.,
C                Y(I)=FUNC(X(I))
C      N    - The integer number of function values supplied.
C                N .GE. 2 unless XLO = XUP.
C      XLO  - DOUBLE PRECISION lower limit of integration
C      XUP  - DOUBLE PRECISION upper limit of integration.  Must have
C              XLO.LE.XUP
C
C         Output--
C      ANS  - Double Precision computed approximate value of integral
C      IERR - A status code
C           --Normal Code
C                =1 Means the requested integration was performed.
C           --Abnormal Codes
C                =2 Means XUP was less than XLO.
C                =3 Means the number of X(I) between XLO and XUP
C                   (inclusive) was less than 3 and neither of the two
C                   special cases described in the abstract occurred.
C                   No integration was performed.
C                =4 Means the restriction X(I+1).GT.X(I) was violated.
C                =5 Means the number N of function values was .lt. 2.
C                   ANS is set to zero if IERR=2,3,4,or 5.
