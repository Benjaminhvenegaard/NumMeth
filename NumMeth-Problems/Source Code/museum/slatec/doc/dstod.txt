C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   DSTOD integrates a system of first order odes over one step in the
C   integrator package DDEBDF.
C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
C DSTOD  performs one step of the integration of an initial value
C problem for a system of ordinary differential equations.
C Note.. DSTOD  is independent of the value of the iteration method
C indicator MITER, when this is .NE. 0, and hence is independent
C of the type of chord method used, or the Jacobian structure.
C Communication with DSTOD  is done with the following variables..
C
C Y      = An array of length .GE. N used as the Y argument in
C          all calls to DF and DJAC.
C NEQ    = Integer array containing problem size in NEQ(1), and
C          passed as the NEQ argument in all calls to DF and DJAC.
C YH     = An NYH by LMAX array containing the dependent variables
C          and their approximate scaled derivatives, where
C          LMAX = MAXORD + 1.  YH(I,J+1) contains the approximate
C          J-th derivative of Y(I), scaled by H**J/FACTORIAL(J)
C          (J = 0,1,...,NQ).  On entry for the first step, the first
C          two columns of YH must be set from the initial values.
C NYH    = A constant integer .GE. N, the first dimension of YH.
C YH1    = A one-dimensional array occupying the same space as YH.
C EWT    = An array of N elements with which the estimated local
C          errors in YH are compared.
C SAVF   = An array of working storage, of length N.
C ACOR   = A work array of length N, used for the accumulated
C          corrections.  On a successful return, ACOR(I) contains
C          the estimated one-step local error in Y(I).
C WM,IWM = DOUBLE PRECISION and INTEGER work arrays associated with
C          matrix operations in chord iteration (MITER .NE. 0).
C DPJAC   = Name of routine to evaluate and preprocess Jacobian matrix
C          if a chord method is being used.
C DSLVS   = Name of routine to solve linear system in chord iteration.
C H      = The step size to be attempted on the next step.
C          H is altered by the error control algorithm during the
C          problem.  H can be either positive or negative, but its
C          sign must remain constant throughout the problem.
C HMIN   = The minimum absolute value of the step size H to be used.
C HMXI   = Inverse of the maximum absolute value of H to be used.
C          HMXI = 0.0 is allowed and corresponds to an infinite HMAX.
C          HMIN and HMXI may be changed at any time, but will not
C          take effect until the next change of H is considered.
C TN     = The independent variable. TN is updated on each step taken.
C JSTART = An integer used for input only, with the following
C          values and meanings..
C               0  Perform the first step.
C           .GT.0  Take a new step continuing from the last.
C              -1  Take the next step with a new value of H, MAXORD,
C                    N, METH, MITER, and/or matrix parameters.
C              -2  Take the next step with a new value of H,
C                    but with other inputs unchanged.
C          On return, JSTART is set to 1 to facilitate continuation.
C KFLAG  = a completion code with the following meanings..
C               0  The step was successful.
C              -1  The requested error could not be achieved.
C              -2  Corrector convergence could not be achieved.
C          A return with KFLAG = -1 or -2 means either
C          ABS(H) = HMIN or 10 consecutive failures occurred.
C          On a return with KFLAG negative, the values of TN and
C          the YH array are as of the beginning of the last
C          step, and H is the last step size attempted.
C MAXORD = The maximum order of integration method to be allowed.
C METH/MITER = The method flags.  See description in driver.
C N      = The number of first-order differential equations.
