C***DESCRIPTION
C
C Evaluate the incomplete gamma function defined by
C
C GAMI = integral from T = 0 to X of EXP(-T) * T**(A-1.0) .
C
C GAMI is evaluated for positive values of A and non-negative values
C of X.  A slight deterioration of 2 or 3 digits accuracy will occur
C when GAMI is very large or very small, because logarithmic variables
C are used.  GAMI, A, and X are single precision.
