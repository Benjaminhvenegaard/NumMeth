C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   This subroutine merges two ascending strings of numbers in the
C   array TCOS.  The first string is of length M1 and starts at
C   TCOS(I1+1).  The second string is of length M2 and starts at
C   TCOS(I2+1).  The merged string goes into TCOS(I3+1).  The ordering
C   is on the real part.
