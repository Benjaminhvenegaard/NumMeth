C     Abstract    **** a double precision routine ****
C         DPFQAD computes the integral on (X1,X2) of a product of a
C         function F and the ID-th derivative of a B-spline, using the
C         PP-representation (C,XI,LXI,K).  (X1,X2) is normally a sub-
C         interval of XI(1) .LE. X .LE. XI(LXI+1).  An integration
C         routine, DPPGQ8 (a modification of GAUS8), integrates the
C         product on subintervals of (X1,X2) formed by the included
C         break points.  Integration outside of (XI(1),XI(LXI+1)) is
C         permitted provided F is defined.
C
C         The maximum number of significant digits obtainable in
C         DBSQAD is the smaller of 18 and the number of digits
C         carried in double precision arithmetic.

C     Description of arguments
C         Input      F,C,XI,X1,X2,TOL are double precision
C           F      - external function of one argument for the
C                    integrand PF(X)=F(X)*DPPVAL(LDC,C,XI,LXI,K,ID,X,
C                    INPPV)
C           LDC    - leading dimension of matrix C, LDC .GE. K
C           C(I,J) - right Taylor derivatives at XI(J), I=1,K , J=1,LXI
C           XI(*)  - break point array of length LXI+1
C           LXI    - number of polynomial pieces
C           K      - order of B-spline, K .GE. 1
C           ID     - order of the spline derivative, 0 .LE. ID .LE. K-1
C                    ID=0 gives the spline function
C           X1,X2  - end points of quadrature interval, normally in
C                    XI(1) .LE. X .LE. XI(LXI+1)
C           TOL    - desired accuracy for the quadrature, suggest
C                    10.*DTOL .LT. TOL .LE. 0.1 where DTOL is the
C                    maximum of 1.0D-18 and double precision unit
C                    roundoff for the machine = D1MACH(4)
C
C         Output     QUAD is double precision
C           QUAD   - integral of PF(X) on (X1,X2)
C           IERR   - a status code
C                    IERR=1 normal return
C                         2 some quadrature does not meet the
C                           requested tolerance
C
C     Error Conditions
C         Improper input is a fatal error.
C         Some quadrature does not meet the requested tolerance.
