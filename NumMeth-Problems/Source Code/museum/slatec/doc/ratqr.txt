C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure RATQR,
C     NUM. MATH. 11, 264-272(1968) by REINSCH and BAUER.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 257-265(1971).
C
C     This subroutine finds the algebraically smallest or largest
C     eigenvalues of a SYMMETRIC TRIDIAGONAL matrix by the
C     rational QR method with Newton corrections.
C
C     On Input
C
C        N is the order of the matrix.  N is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        EPS1 is a theoretical absolute error tolerance for the
C          computed eigenvalues.  If the input EPS1 is non-positive, or
C          indeed smaller than its default value, it is reset at each
C          iteration to the respective default value, namely, the
C          product of the relative machine precision and the magnitude
C          of the current eigenvalue iterate.  The theoretical absolute
C          error in the K-th eigenvalue is usually not greater than
C          K times EPS1.  EPS1 is a REAL variable.
C
C        D contains the diagonal elements of the symmetric tridiagonal
C          matrix.  D is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned D(N).
C
C        E contains the subdiagonal elements of the symmetric
C          tridiagonal matrix in its last N-1 positions.  E(1) is
C          arbitrary.  E is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned
C          E(N).
C
C        E2 contains the squares of the corresponding elements of E in
C          its last N-1 positions.  E2(1) is arbitrary.  E2 is a one-
C          dimensional REAL array, dimensioned E2(N).
C
C        M is the number of eigenvalues to be found.  M is an INTEGER
C          variable.
C
C        IDEF should be set to 1 if the input matrix is known to be
C          positive definite, to -1 if the input matrix is known to
C          be negative definite, and to 0 otherwise.  IDEF is an
C          INTEGER variable.
C
C        TYPE should be set to .TRUE. if the smallest eigenvalues are
C          to be found, and to .FALSE. if the largest eigenvalues are
C          to be found.  TYPE is a LOGICAL variable.
C
C     On Output
C
C        EPS1 is unaltered unless it has been reset to its
C          (last) default value.
C
C        D and E are unaltered (unless W overwrites D).
C
C        Elements of E2, corresponding to elements of E regarded as
C          negligible, have been replaced by zero causing the matrix
C          to split into a direct sum of submatrices.  E2(1) is set
C          to 0.0e0 if the smallest eigenvalues have been found, and
C          to 2.0e0 if the largest eigenvalues have been found.  E2
C          is otherwise unaltered (unless overwritten by BD).
C
C        W contains the M algebraically smallest eigenvalues in
C          ascending order, or the M largest eigenvalues in descending
C          order.  If an error exit is made because of an incorrect
C          specification of IDEF, no eigenvalues are found.  If the
C          Newton iterates for a particular eigenvalue are not monotone,
C          the best estimate obtained is returned and IERR is set.
C          W is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned W(N).  W need
C          not be distinct from D.
C
C        IND contains in its first M positions the submatrix indices
C          associated with the corresponding eigenvalues in W --
C          1 for eigenvalues belonging to the first submatrix from
C          the top, 2 for those belonging to the second submatrix, etc.
C          IND is an one-dimensional INTEGER array, dimensioned IND(N).
C
C        BD contains refined bounds for the theoretical errors of the
C          corresponding eigenvalues in W.  These bounds are usually
C          within the tolerance specified by EPS1.  BD is a one-
C          dimensional REAL array, dimensioned BD(N).  BD need not be
C          distinct from E2.
C
C        IERR is an INTEGER flag set to
C          Zero       for normal return,
C          6*N+1      if  IDEF  is set to 1 and  TYPE  to .TRUE.
C                     when the matrix is NOT positive definite, or
C                     if  IDEF  is set to -1 and  TYPE  to .FALSE.
C                     when the matrix is NOT negative definite,
C                     no eigenvalues are computed, or
C                     M is greater than N,
C          5*N+K      if successive iterates to the K-th eigenvalue
C                     are NOT monotone increasing, where K refers
C                     to the last such occurrence.
C
C     Note that subroutine TRIDIB is generally faster and more
C     accurate than RATQR if the eigenvalues are clustered.
