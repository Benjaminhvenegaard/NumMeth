C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Abstract
C      SGEEV computes the eigenvalues and, optionally,
C      the eigenvectors of a general real matrix.
C
C     Call Sequence Parameters-
C       (The values of parameters marked with * (star) will be changed
C         by SGEEV.)
C
C        A*      REAL(LDA,N)
C                real nonsymmetric input matrix.
C
C        LDA     INTEGER
C                set by the user to
C                the leading dimension of the real array A.
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                set by the user to
C                the order of the matrices A and V, and
C                the number of elements in E.
C
C        E*      COMPLEX(N)
C                on return from SGEEV, E contains the eigenvalues of A.
C                See also INFO below.
C
C        V*      COMPLEX(LDV,N)
C                on return from SGEEV, if the user has set JOB
C                = 0        V is not referenced.
C                = nonzero  the N eigenvectors of A are stored in the
C                first N columns of V.  See also INFO below.
C                (Note that if the input matrix A is nearly degenerate,
C                 V may be badly conditioned, i.e., may have nearly
C                 dependent columns.)
C
C        LDV     INTEGER
C                set by the user to
C                the leading dimension of the array V if JOB is also
C                set nonzero.  In that case, N must be .LE. LDV.
C                If JOB is set to zero, LDV is not referenced.
C
C        WORK*   REAL(2N)
C                temporary storage vector.  Contents changed by SGEEV.
C
C        JOB     INTEGER
C                set by the user to
C                = 0        eigenvalues only to be calculated by SGEEV.
C                           Neither V nor LDV is referenced.
C                = nonzero  eigenvalues and vectors to be calculated.
C                           In this case, A & V must be distinct arrays.
C                           Also, if LDA .GT. LDV, SGEEV changes all the
C                           elements of A thru column N.  If LDA < LDV,
C                           SGEEV changes all the elements of V through
C                           column N. If LDA = LDV, only A(I,J) and V(I,
C                           J) for I,J = 1,...,N are changed by SGEEV.
C
C        INFO*   INTEGER
C                on return from SGEEV the value of INFO is
C                = 0  normal return, calculation successful.
C                = K  if the eigenvalue iteration fails to converge,
C                     eigenvalues K+1 through N are correct, but
C                     no eigenvectors were computed even if they were
C                     requested (JOB nonzero).
