C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Fehlberg Fourth-Fifth order Runge-Kutta Method
C **********************************************************************
C
C    DEFEHL integrates a system of NEQ first order
C    ordinary differential equations of the form
C               dU/DX = F(X,U)
C    over one step when the vector Y(*) of initial values for U(*) and
C    the vector YP(*) of initial derivatives, satisfying  YP = F(T,Y),
C    are given at the starting point X=T.
C
C    DEFEHL advances the solution over the fixed step H and returns
C    the fifth order (sixth order accurate locally) solution
C    approximation at T+H in the array YS(*).
C    F1,---,F5 are arrays of dimension NEQ which are needed
C    for internal storage.
C    The formulas have been grouped to control loss of significance.
C    DEFEHL should be called with an H not smaller than 13 units of
C    roundoff in T so that the various independent arguments can be
C    distinguished.
C
C    This subroutine has been written with all variables and statement
C    numbers entirely compatible with DERKFS. For greater efficiency,
C    the call to DEFEHL can be replaced by the module beginning with
C    line 222 and extending to the last line just before the return
C    statement.
