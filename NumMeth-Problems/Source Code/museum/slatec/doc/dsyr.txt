C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  DSYR   performs the symmetric rank 1 operation
C
C     A := alpha*x*x' + A,
C
C  where alpha is a real scalar, x is an n element vector and A is an
C  n by n symmetric matrix.
C
C  Parameters
C  ==========
C
C  UPLO   - CHARACTER*1.
C           On entry, UPLO specifies whether the upper or lower
C           triangular part of the array A is to be referenced as
C           follows:
C
C              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   Only the upper triangular part of A
C                                  is to be referenced.
C
C              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   Only the lower triangular part of A
C                                  is to be referenced.
C
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  N      - INTEGER.
C           On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A.
C           N must be at least zero.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  ALPHA  - DOUBLE PRECISION.
C           On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  X      - DOUBLE PRECISION array of dimension at least
C           ( 1 + ( n - 1)*abs( INCX)).
C           Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the n
C           element vector x.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  INCX   - INTEGER.
C           On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of
C           X. INCX must not be zero.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  A      - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION ( LDA, n ).
C           Before entry with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the leading n by n
C           upper triangular part of the array A must contain the upper
C           triangular part of the symmetric matrix and the strictly
C           lower triangular part of A is not referenced. On exit, the
C           upper triangular part of the array A is overwritten by the
C           upper triangular part of the updated matrix.
C           Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the leading n by n
C           lower triangular part of the array A must contain the lower
C           triangular part of the symmetric matrix and the strictly
C           upper triangular part of A is not referenced. On exit, the
C           lower triangular part of the array A is overwritten by the
C           lower triangular part of the updated matrix.
C
C  LDA    - INTEGER.
C           On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
C           in the calling (sub) program. LDA must be at least
C           max( 1, n ).
C           Unchanged on exit.
