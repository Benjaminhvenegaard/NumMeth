C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   1.     RF
C          Evaluate an INCOMPLETE (or COMPLETE) ELLIPTIC INTEGRAL
C          of the first kind
C          Standard FORTRAN function routine
C          Single precision version
C          The routine calculates an approximation result to
C          RF(X,Y,Z) = Integral from zero to infinity of
C
C                               -1/2     -1/2     -1/2
C                     (1/2)(t+X)    (t+Y)    (t+Z)    dt,
C
C          where X, Y, and Z are nonnegative and at most one of them
C          is zero.  If one of them is zero, the integral is COMPLETE.
C          The duplication theorem is iterated until the variables are
C          nearly equal, and the function is then expanded in Taylor
C          series to fifth order.

C                   IER = 0 Normal and reliable termination of the
C                           routine.  It is assumed that the requested
C                           accuracy has been achieved.

C
C
C   4.     Control Parameters
C
C                  Values of LOLIM, UPLIM, and ERRTOL are set by the
C                  routine.
C
C          LOLIM and UPLIM determine the valid range of X, Y and Z
C
C          LOLIM  - Lower limit of valid arguments
C
C                   Not less than 5 * (machine minimum).
C
C          UPLIM  - Upper limit of valid arguments
C
C                   Not greater than (machine maximum) / 5.
C
C
C                     Acceptable Values For:   LOLIM      UPLIM
C                     IBM 360/370 SERIES   :   3.0E-78     1.0E+75
C                     CDC 6000/7000 SERIES :   1.0E-292    1.0E+321
C                     UNIVAC 1100 SERIES   :   1.0E-37     1.0E+37
C                     CRAY                 :   2.3E-2466   1.09E+2465
C                     VAX 11 SERIES        :   1.5E-38     3.0E+37
C
C
C
C          ERRTOL determines the accuracy of the answer
C
C                 The value assigned by the routine will result
C                 in solution precision within 1-2 decimals of
C                 "machine precision".
C
C
C
C          ERRTOL - Relative error due to truncation is less than
C                   ERRTOL ** 6 / (4 * (1-ERRTOL)  .
C
C
C
C              The accuracy of the computed approximation to the inte-
C              gral can be controlled by choosing the value of ERRTOL.
C              Truncation of a Taylor series after terms of fifth order
C              introduces an error less than the amount shown in the
C              second column of the following table for each value of
C              ERRTOL in the first column.  In addition to the trunca-
C              tion error there will be round-off error, but in prac-
C              tice the total error from both sources is usually less
C              than the amount given in the table.
C
C
C
C
C
C          Sample Choices:  ERRTOL   Relative Truncation
C                                    error less than
C                           1.0E-3    3.0E-19
C                           3.0E-3    2.0E-16
C                           1.0E-2    3.0E-13
C                           3.0E-2    2.0E-10
C                           1.0E-1    3.0E-7
C
C
C                    Decreasing ERRTOL by a factor of 10 yields six more
C                    decimal digits of accuracy at the expense of one or
C                    two more iterations of the duplication theorem.
