C***DESCRIPTION
C
C PRODP applies a sequence of matrix operations to the vector X and
C stores the result in YY. (Periodic boundary conditions and COMPLEX
C case)
C
C BD,BM1,BM2     are arrays containing roots of certain B polynomials.
C ND,NM1,NM2     are the lengths of the arrays BD,BM1,BM2 respectively.
C AA             Array containing scalar multipliers of the vector X.
C NA             is the length of the array AA.
C X,YY      The matrix operations are applied to X and the result is YY.
C A,B,C          are arrays which contain the tridiagonal matrix.
C M              is the order of the matrix.
C D,U,Y          are working arrays.
C ISGN           determines whether or not a change in sign is made.
