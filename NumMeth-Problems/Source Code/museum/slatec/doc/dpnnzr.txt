C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     DPNNZR LIMITS THE TYPE OF STORAGE TO A SEQUENTIAL SCHEME.
C     SPARSE MATRIX NON ZERO RETRIEVAL SUBROUTINE.
C
C     SUBROUTINE DPNNZR() GETS THE NEXT NONZERO VALUE IN ROW OR COLUMN
C     +/- IRCX WITH AN INDEX GREATER THAN THE VALUE OF I.
C
C             I ABSOLUTE VALUE OF THIS SUBSCRIPT IS TO BE EXCEEDED
C               IN THE SEARCH FOR THE NEXT NONZERO VALUE. A NEGATIVE
C               OR ZERO VALUE OF I CAUSES THE SEARCH TO START AT
C               THE BEGINNING OF THE VECTOR.  A POSITIVE VALUE
C               OF I CAUSES THE SEARCH TO CONTINUE FROM THE LAST PLACE
C               ACCESSED. ON OUTPUT, THE ARGUMENT I
C               CONTAINS THE VALUE OF THE SUBSCRIPT FOUND.  AN OUTPUT
C               VALUE OF I EQUAL TO ZERO INDICATES THAT ALL COMPONENTS
C               WITH AN INDEX GREATER THAN THE INPUT VALUE OF I ARE
C               ZERO.
C          XVAL VALUE OF THE NONZERO ELEMENT FOUND.  ON OUTPUT,
C               XVAL=0. WHENEVER I=0.
C     IPLACE POINTER INFORMATION WHICH IS MAINTAINED BY THE PACKAGE.
C   SX(*),IX(*) THE WORK ARRAYS WHICH ARE USED TO STORE THE SPARSE
C               MATRIX.  THESE ARRAY CONTENTS ARE AUTOMATICALLY
C               MAINTAINED BY THE PACKAGE FOR THE USER.
C          IRCX POINTS TO THE VECTOR OF THE MATRIX BEING SCANNED.  A
C               NEGATIVE VALUE OF IRCX INDICATES THAT ROW -IRCX IS TO BE
C               SCANNED.  A POSITIVE VALUE OF IRCX INDICATES THAT
C               COLUMN IRCX IS TO BE SCANNED.  A ZERO VALUE OF IRCX IS
C               AN ERROR.
