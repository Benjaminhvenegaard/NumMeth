C***PURPOSE  Sort an integer array, moving an integer and DP array.
C            This routine sorts the integer array IA and makes the same
C            interchanges in the integer array JA and the double pre-
C            cision array A.  The array IA may be sorted in increasing
C            order or decreasing order.  A slightly modified QUICKSORT
C            algorithm is used.

C     ABSTRACT
C         This routine sorts an integer array IA and makes the same
C         interchanges in the integer array JA and the double precision
C         array A.
C         The array IA may be sorted in increasing order or decreasing
C         order.  A slightly modified quicksort algorithm is used.

C     DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
C        IA - Integer array of values to be sorted.
C        JA - Integer array to be carried along.
C         A - Double Precision array to be carried along.
C         N - Number of values in integer array IA to be sorted.
C     KFLAG - Control parameter
C           = 1 means sort IA in INCREASING order.
C           =-1 means sort IA in DECREASING order.
