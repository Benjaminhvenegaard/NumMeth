C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure
C     CBABK2, which is a complex version of BALBAK,
C     NUM. MATH. 13, 293-304(1969) by Parlett and Reinsch.

C
C     This subroutine forms the eigenvectors of a COMPLEX GENERAL
C     matrix by back transforming those of the corresponding
C     balanced matrix determined by  CBAL.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional
C          array parameters, ZR and ZI, as declared in the calling
C          program dimension statement.  NM is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix Z=(ZR,ZI).  N is an INTEGER
C          variable.  N must be less than or equal to NM.
C
C        LOW and IGH are INTEGER variables determined by  CBAL.
C
C        SCALE contains information determining the permutations and
C          scaling factors used by  CBAL.  SCALE is a one-dimensional
C          REAL array, dimensioned SCALE(N).
C
C        M is the number of eigenvectors to be back transformed.
C          M is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        ZR and ZI contain the real and imaginary parts, respectively,
C          of the eigenvectors to be back transformed in their first
C          M columns.  ZR and ZI are two-dimensional REAL arrays,
C          dimensioned ZR(NM,M) and ZI(NM,M).
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        ZR and ZI contain the real and imaginary parts,
C          respectively, of the transformed eigenvectors
C          in their first M columns.
