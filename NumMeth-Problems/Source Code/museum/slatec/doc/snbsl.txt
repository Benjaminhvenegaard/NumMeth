C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     SNBSL solves the real band system
C     A * X = B  or  TRANS(A) * X = B
C     using the factors computed by SNBCO or SNBFA.
C
C     On Entry
C
C        ABE     REAL(LDA, NC)
C                the output from SNBCO or SNBFA.
C                NC must be .GE. 2*ML+MU+1 .
C
C        LDA     INTEGER
C                the leading dimension of the array  ABE .
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the original matrix.
C
C        ML      INTEGER
C                number of diagonals below the main diagonal.
C
C        MU      INTEGER
C                number of diagonals above the main diagonal.
C
C        IPVT    INTEGER(N)
C                the pivot vector from SNBCO or SNBFA.
C
C        B       REAL(N)
C                the right hand side vector.
C
C        JOB     INTEGER
C                = 0         to solve  A*X = B .
C                = nonzero   to solve  TRANS(A)*X = B , where
C                            TRANS(A)  is the transpose.
C
C     On Return
C
C        B       the solution vector  X .
C
C     Error Condition
C
C        A division by zero will occur if the input factor contains a
C        zero on the diagonal.  Technically, this indicates singularity,
C        but it is often caused by improper arguments or improper
C        setting of LDA.  It will not occur if the subroutines are
C        called correctly and if SNBCO has set RCOND .GT. 0.0
C        or SNBFA has set INFO .EQ. 0 .
C
C     To compute  INVERSE(A) * C  where  C  is a matrix
C     with  P  columns
C           CALL SNBCO(ABE,LDA,N,ML,MU,IPVT,RCOND,Z)
C           IF (RCOND is too small) GO TO ...
C           DO 10 J = 1, P
C             CALL SNBSL(ABE,LDA,N,ML,MU,IPVT,C(1,J),0)
C        10 CONTINUE
