C **********************************************************************
C   -Input-
C
C     FNC- Function subprogram which evaluates the equations
C     N  -number of equations
C     S  -Solution vector of initial guesses
C     RTOLX-Relative error tolerance on solution components
C     ATOLX-Absolute error tolerance on solution components
C     TOLF-Residual error tolerance
C     MXIT-Maximum number of allowable iterations.
C     NCJS-Maximum number of consecutive iterative steps to perform
C          using the same triangular Jacobian matrix approximation.
C     NSRRC-Number of consecutive iterative steps for which the
C          limiting precision accuracy test must be satisfied
C          before the routine exits with IFLAG=4.
C     NSRI-Number of consecutive iterative steps for which the
C          diverging condition test must be satisfied before
C          the routine exits with IFLAG=7.
C     IPRINT-Internal printing parameter. You must set IPRINT=-1 if you
C          want the intermediate solution iterates and a residual norm
C          to be printed.
C     C   -Internal work array, dimensioned at least N*(N+1)/2.
C     NC  -Dimension of C array. NC  .GE.  N*(N+1)/2.
C     B   -Internal work array, dimensioned N.
C     P   -Internal work array, dimensioned N.
C     TEMP-Internal work array, dimensioned N.
C     X   -Internal work array, dimensioned N.
C     Y   -Internal work array, dimensioned N.
C     FAC -Internal work array, dimensioned N.
C     IS  -Internal work array, dimensioned N.
C
C   -Output-
C     S    -Solution vector
C     IFLAG-Status indicator flag
C     MXIT-The actual number of iterations performed
C     FMAX-Residual norm
C     C   -Upper unit triangular matrix which approximates the
C          forward triangularization of the full Jacobian matrix.
C          Stored in a vector with dimension at least N*(N+1)/2.
C     B   -Contains the residuals (function values) divided
C          by the corresponding components of the P vector
C     P   -Array used to store the partial derivatives. After
C          each iteration P(K) contains the maximal derivative
C          occurring in the K-th reduced equation.
C     TEMP-Array used to store the previous solution iterate.
C     X   -Solution vector. Contains the values achieved on the
C          last iteration loop upon exit from DSOS.
C     Y   -Array containing the solution increments.
C     FAC -Array containing factors used in computing numerical
C          derivatives.
C     IS  -Records the pivotal information (column interchanges)
