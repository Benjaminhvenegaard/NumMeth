C***DESCRIPTION
C
C        CUNIK COMPUTES PARAMETERS FOR THE UNIFORM ASYMPTOTIC
C        EXPANSIONS OF THE I AND K FUNCTIONS ON IKFLG= 1 OR 2
C        RESPECTIVELY BY
C
C        W(FNU,ZR) = PHI*EXP(ZETA)*SUM
C
C        WHERE       ZETA=-ZETA1 + ZETA2       OR
C                          ZETA1 - ZETA2
C
C        THE FIRST CALL MUST HAVE INIT=0. SUBSEQUENT CALLS WITH THE
C        SAME ZR AND FNU WILL RETURN THE I OR K FUNCTION ON IKFLG=
C        1 OR 2 WITH NO CHANGE IN INIT. CWRK IS A COMPLEX WORK
C        ARRAY. IPMTR=0 COMPUTES ALL PARAMETERS. IPMTR=1 COMPUTES PHI,
C        ZETA1,ZETA2.
