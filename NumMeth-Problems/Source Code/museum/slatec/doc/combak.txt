C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure COMBAK,
C     NUM. MATH. 12, 349-368(1968) by Martin and Wilkinson.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 339-358(1971).
C
C     This subroutine forms the eigenvectors of a COMPLEX GENERAL
C     matrix by back transforming those of the corresponding
C     upper Hessenberg matrix determined by  COMHES.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional
C          array parameters, AR, AI, ZR and ZI, as declared in the
C          calling program dimension statement.  NM is an INTEGER
C          variable.
C
C        LOW and IGH are two INTEGER variables determined by the
C          balancing subroutine  CBAL.  If  CBAL  has not been used,
C          set LOW=1 and IGH equal to the order of the matrix.
C
C        AR and AI contain the multipliers which were used in the
C           reduction by  COMHES  in their lower triangles below
C           the subdiagonal.  AR and AI are two-dimensional REAL
C           arrays, dimensioned AR(NM,IGH) and AI(NM,IGH).
C
C        INT contains information on the rows and columns
C          interchanged in the reduction by  COMHES.  Only
C          elements LOW through IGH are used.  INT is a
C          one-dimensional INTEGER array, dimensioned INT(IGH).
C
C        M is the number of eigenvectors to be back transformed.
C          M is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        ZR and ZI contain the real and imaginary parts, respectively,
C          of the eigenvectors to be back transformed in their first M
C          columns.  ZR and ZI are two-dimensional REAL arrays,
C          dimensioned ZR(NM,M) and ZI(NM,M).
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        ZR and ZI contain the real and imaginary parts, respectively,
C          of the transformed eigenvectors in their first M columns.
