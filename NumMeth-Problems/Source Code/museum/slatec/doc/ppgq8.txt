C***DESCRIPTION

C     Abstract
C        PPGQ8, a modification of GAUS8, integrates the
C        product of FUN(X) by the ID-th derivative of a spline
C        PPVAL(LDC,C,XI,LXI,KK,ID,X,INPPV)  between limits A and B.
C
C     Description of arguments
C
C        INPUT--
C        FUN - Name of external function of one argument which
C              multiplies PPVAL.
C        LDC - Leading dimension of matrix C, LDC.GE.KK
C        C   - Matrix of Taylor derivatives of dimension at least
C              (K,LXI)
C        XI  - Breakpoint vector of length LXI+1
C        LXI - Number of polynomial pieces
C        KK  - Order of the spline, KK.GE.1
C        ID  - Order of the spline derivative, 0.LE.ID.LE.KK-1
C        A   - Lower limit of integral
C        B   - Upper limit of integral (may be less than A)
C        INPPV- Initialization parameter for PPVAL
C        ERR - Is a requested pseudorelative error tolerance.  Normally
C              pick a value of ABS(ERR).LT.1E-3.  ANS will normally
C              have no more error than ABS(ERR) times the integral of
C              the absolute value of FUN(X)*PPVAL(LDC,C,XI,LXI,KK,ID,X,
C              INPPV).
C
C        OUTPUT--
C        ERR - Will be an estimate of the absolute error in ANS if the
C              input value of ERR was negative.  (ERR is unchanged if
C              the input value of ERR was nonnegative.)  The estimated
C              error is solely for information to the user and should
C              not be used as a correction to the computed integral.
C        ANS - Computed value of integral
C        IERR- A status code
C            --Normal codes
C               1 ANS most likely meets requested error tolerance,
C                 or A=B.
C              -1 A and B ARE too nearly equal to allow normal
C                 integration.  ANS is set to zero.
C            --Abnormal code
C               2 ANS probably does not meet requested error tolerance.
