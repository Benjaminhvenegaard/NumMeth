C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure TQL2,
C     NUM. MATH. 11, 293-306(1968) by Bowdler, Martin, Reinsch, and
C     Wilkinson.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 227-240(1971).
C
C     This subroutine finds the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
C     of a SYMMETRIC TRIDIAGONAL matrix by the QL method.
C     The eigenvectors of a FULL SYMMETRIC matrix can also
C     be found if  TRED2  has been used to reduce this
C     full matrix to tridiagonal form.
C
C     On Input
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional
C          array parameter, Z, as declared in the calling program
C          dimension statement.  NM is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix.  N is an INTEGER variable.
C          N must be less than or equal to NM.
C
C        D contains the diagonal elements of the symmetric tridiagonal
C          matrix.  D is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned D(N).
C
C        E contains the subdiagonal elements of the symmetric
C          tridiagonal matrix in its last N-1 positions.  E(1) is
C          arbitrary.  E is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned
C          E(N).
C
C        Z contains the transformation matrix produced in the
C          reduction by  TRED2, if performed.  If the eigenvectors
C          of the tridiagonal matrix are desired, Z must contain
C          the identity matrix.  Z is a two-dimensional REAL array,
C          dimensioned Z(NM,N).
C
C      On Output
C
C        D contains the eigenvalues in ascending order.  If an
C          error exit is made, the eigenvalues are correct but
C          unordered for indices 1, 2, ..., IERR-1.
C
C        E has been destroyed.
C
C        Z contains orthonormal eigenvectors of the symmetric
C          tridiagonal (or full) matrix.  If an error exit is made,
C          Z contains the eigenvectors associated with the stored
C          eigenvalues.
C
C        IERR is an INTEGER flag set to
C          Zero       for normal return,
C          J          if the J-th eigenvalue has not been
C                     determined after 30 iterations.
C
C     Calls PYTHAG(A,B) for sqrt(A**2 + B**2).
