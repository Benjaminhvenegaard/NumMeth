C     Abstract    **** a double precision routine ****
C
C         DBSPVD is the BSPLVD routine of the reference.
C
C         DBSPVD calculates the value and all derivatives of order
C         less than NDERIV of all basis functions which do not
C         (possibly) vanish at X.  ILEFT is input such that
C         T(ILEFT) .LE. X .LT. T(ILEFT+1).  A call to INTRV(T,N+1,X,
C         ILO,ILEFT,MFLAG) will produce the proper ILEFT.  The output of
C         DBSPVD is a matrix VNIKX(I,J) of dimension at least (K,NDERIV)
C         whose columns contain the K nonzero basis functions and
C         their NDERIV-1 right derivatives at X, I=1,K, J=1,NDERIV.
C         These basis functions have indices ILEFT-K+I, I=1,K,
C         K .LE. ILEFT .LE. N.  The nonzero part of the I-th basis
C         function lies in (T(I),T(I+K)), I=1,N).
C
C         If X=T(ILEFT+1) then VNIKX contains left limiting values
C         (left derivatives) at T(ILEFT+1).  In particular, ILEFT = N
C         produces left limiting values at the right end point
C         X=T(N+1).  To obtain left limiting values at T(I), I=K+1,N+1,
C         set X= next lower distinct knot, call INTRV to get ILEFT,
C         set X=T(I), and then call DBSPVD.
