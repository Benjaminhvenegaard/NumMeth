C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure ORTHES,
C     NUM. MATH. 12, 349-368(1968) by Martin and Wilkinson.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 339-358(1971).
C
C     Given a REAL GENERAL matrix, this subroutine
C     reduces a submatrix situated in rows and columns
C     LOW through IGH to upper Hessenberg form by
C     orthogonal similarity transformations.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional
C          array parameter, A, as declared in the calling program
C          dimension statement.  NM is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix A.  N is an INTEGER variable.
C          N must be less than or equal to NM.
C
C        LOW and IGH are two INTEGER variables determined by the
C          balancing subroutine  BALANC.  If  BALANC  has not been
C          used, set LOW=1 and IGH equal to the order of the matrix, N.
C
C        A contains the general matrix to be reduced to upper
C          Hessenberg form.  A is a two-dimensional REAL array,
C          dimensioned A(NM,N).
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        A contains the upper Hessenberg matrix.  Some information about
C          the orthogonal transformations used in the reduction
C          is stored in the remaining triangle under the Hessenberg
C          matrix.
C
C        ORT contains further information about the orthogonal trans-
C          formations used in the reduction.  Only elements LOW+1
C          through IGH are used.  ORT is a one-dimensional REAL array,
C          dimensioned ORT(IGH).
