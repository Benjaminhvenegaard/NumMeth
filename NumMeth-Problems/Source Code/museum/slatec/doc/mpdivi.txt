C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  Divides 'mp' X by the single-precision integer IY giving 'mp' Z.
C  This is much faster than division by an 'mp' number.
C
C  The arguments X(*) and Z(*), and the variable R in COMMON are all
C  INTEGER arrays of size 30.  See the comments in the routine MPBLAS
C  for the reason for this choice.
