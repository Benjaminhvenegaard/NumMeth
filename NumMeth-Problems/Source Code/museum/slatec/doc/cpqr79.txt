C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   Abstract
C       This routine computes all zeros of a polynomial of degree NDEG
C       with complex coefficients by computing the eigenvalues of the
C       companion matrix.
C
C   Description of Parameters
C       The user must dimension all arrays appearing in the call list
C            COEFF(NDEG+1), ROOT(NDEG), WORK(2*NDEG*(NDEG+1))
C
C    --Input--
C      NDEG    degree of polynomial
C
C      COEFF   COMPLEX coefficients in descending order.  i.e.,
C              P(Z)= COEFF(1)*(Z**NDEG) + COEFF(NDEG)*Z + COEFF(NDEG+1)
C
C      WORK    REAL work array of dimension at least 2*NDEG*(NDEG+1)
C
C   --Output--
C      ROOT    COMPLEX vector of roots
C
C      IERR    Output Error Code
C           - Normal Code
C          0  means the roots were computed.
C           - Abnormal Codes
C          1  more than 30 QR iterations on some eigenvalue of the
C             companion matrix
C          2  COEFF(1)=0.0
C          3  NDEG is invalid (less than or equal to 0)
