C***LIBRARY   SLATEC
C***CATEGORY  A3D
C***TYPE      DOUBLE PRECISION (XADJ-S, DXADJ-D)

C***DESCRIPTION
C     DOUBLE PRECISION X
C     INTEGER IX
C
C                  TRANSFORMS (X,IX) SO THAT
C                  RADIX**(-L) .LE. ABS(X) .LT. RADIX**L.
C                  ON MOST COMPUTERS THIS TRANSFORMATION DOES
C                  NOT CHANGE THE MANTISSA OF X PROVIDED RADIX IS
C                  THE NUMBER BASE OF DOUBLE-PRECISION ARITHMETIC.
