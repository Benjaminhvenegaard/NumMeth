C***PURPOSE  The routine determines the limit of a given sequence of
C            approximations, by means of the Epsilon algorithm of
C            P.Wynn. An estimate of the absolute error is also given.
C            The condensed Epsilon table is computed. Only those
C            elements needed for the computation of the next diagonal
C            are preserved.

C           PARAMETERS
C              N      - Integer
C                       EPSTAB(N) contains the new element in the

C              EPSTAB - Double precision
C                       Vector of dimension 52 containing the elements
C                       of the two lower diagonals of the triangular
C                       epsilon table. The elements are numbered
C                       starting at the right-hand corner of the
C                       triangle.
