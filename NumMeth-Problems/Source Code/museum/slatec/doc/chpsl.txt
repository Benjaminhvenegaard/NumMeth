C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     CHISL solves the complex Hermitian system
C     A * X = B
C     using the factors computed by CHPFA.
C
C     On Entry
C
C        AP      COMPLEX(N*(N+1)/2)
C                the output from CHPFA.
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the matrix  A .
C
C        KVPT    INTEGER(N)
C                the pivot vector from CHPFA.
C
C        B       COMPLEX(N)
C                the right hand side vector.
C
C     On Return
C
C        B       the solution vector  X .
C
C     Error Condition
C
C        A division by zero may occur if  CHPCO  has set RCOND .EQ. 0.0
C        or  CHPFA  has set INFO .NE. 0  .
C
C     To compute  INVERSE(A) * C  where  C  is a matrix
C     with  P  columns
C           CALL CHPFA(AP,N,KVPT,INFO)
C           IF (INFO .NE. 0) GO TO ...
C           DO 10 J = 1, P
C              CALL CHPSL(AP,N,KVPT,C(1,J))
C        10 CONTINUE
