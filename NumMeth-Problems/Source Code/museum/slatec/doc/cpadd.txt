C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   CPADD computes the eigenvalues of the periodic tridiagonal matrix
C   with coefficients AN,BN,CN.
C
C   N    is the order of the BH and BP polynomials.
C   BP   contains the eigenvalues on output.
C   CBP  is the same as BP except type complex.
C   BH   is used to temporarily store the roots of the B HAT polynomial
C        which enters through BP.
