C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Abstract
C
C     The subroutine  DP1VLU  uses the coefficients generated by  DPOLFT
C     to evaluate the polynomial fit of degree  L , along with the first
C     NDER  of its derivatives, at a specified point.  Computationally
C     stable recurrence relations are used to perform this task.
C
C     The parameters for  DP1VLU  are
C
C     Input -- ALL TYPE REAL variables are DOUBLE PRECISION
C         L -      the degree of polynomial to be evaluated.  L  may be
C                  any non-negative integer which is less than or equal
C                  to  NDEG , the highest degree polynomial provided
C                  by  DPOLFT .
C         NDER -   the number of derivatives to be evaluated.  NDER
C                  may be 0 or any positive value.  If NDER is less
C                  than 0, it will be treated as 0.
C         X -      the argument at which the polynomial and its
C                  derivatives are to be evaluated.
C         A -      work and output array containing values from last
C                  call to  DPOLFT .
C
C     Output -- ALL TYPE REAL variables are DOUBLE PRECISION
C         YFIT -   value of the fitting polynomial of degree  L  at  X
C         YP -     array containing the first through  NDER  derivatives
C                  of the polynomial of degree  L .  YP  must be
C                  dimensioned at least  NDER  in the calling program.
