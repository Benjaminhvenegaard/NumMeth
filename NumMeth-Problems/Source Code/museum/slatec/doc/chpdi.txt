C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     CHPDI computes the determinant, inertia and inverse
C     of a complex Hermitian matrix using the factors from CHPFA,
C     where the matrix is stored in packed form.
C
C     On Entry
C
C        AP      COMPLEX (N*(N+1)/2)
C                the output from CHPFA.
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the matrix A.
C
C        KVPT    INTEGER(N)
C                the pivot vector from CHPFA.
C
C        WORK    COMPLEX(N)
C                work vector.  Contents ignored.
C
C        JOB     INTEGER
C                JOB has the decimal expansion  ABC  where
C                   if  C .NE. 0, the inverse is computed,
C                   if  B .NE. 0, the determinant is computed,
C                   if  A .NE. 0, the inertia is computed.
C
C                For example, JOB = 111  gives all three.
C
C     On Return
C
C        Variables not requested by JOB are not used.
C
C        AP     contains the upper triangle of the inverse of
C               the original matrix, stored in packed form.
C               The columns of the upper triangle are stored
C               sequentially in a one-dimensional array.
C
C        DET    REAL(2)
C               determinant of original matrix.
C               Determinant = DET(1) * 10.0**DET(2)
C               with 1.0 .LE. ABS(DET(1)) .LT. 10.0
C               or DET(1) = 0.0.
C
C        INERT  INTEGER(3)
C               the inertia of the original matrix.
C               INERT(1)  =  number of positive eigenvalues.
C               INERT(2)  =  number of negative eigenvalues.
C               INERT(3)  =  number of zero eigenvalues.
C
C     Error Condition
C
C        A division by zero will occur if the inverse is requested
C        and  CHPCO  has set RCOND .EQ. 0.0
C        or  CHPFA  has set  INFO .NE. 0 .
