C***BEGIN PROLOGUE  SMOUT
C***SUBSIDIARY
C***PURPOSE  Subsidiary to FC and SBOCLS
C***LIBRARY   SLATEC
C***TYPE      SINGLE PRECISION (SMOUT-S, DMOUT-D)
C***AUTHOR  (UNKNOWN)
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     SINGLE PRECISION MATRIX OUTPUT ROUTINE.
C
C  INPUT..
C
C  M,N,LDA,A(*,*) PRINT THE SINGLE PRECISION ARRAY A(I,J),I  = 1,...,M,
C                 J=1,...,N, ON OUTPUT UNIT LOUT=6. LDA IS THE DECLARED
C                 FIRST DIMENSION OF A(*,*) AS SPECIFIED IN THE CALLING
C                 PROGRAM. THE HEADING IN THE FORTRAN FORMAT STATEMENT
C                 IFMT(*), DESCRIBED BELOW, IS PRINTED AS A FIRST STEP.
C                 THE COMPONENTS A(I,J) ARE INDEXED, ON OUTPUT, IN A
C                 PLEASANT FORMAT.
C  IFMT(*)        A FORTRAN FORMAT STATEMENT. THIS IS PRINTED ON
C                 OUTPUT UNIT LOUT=6 WITH THE VARIABLE FORMAT FORTRAN
C                 STATEMENT
C                       WRITE(LOUT,IFMT).
C  IDIGIT         PRINT AT LEAST ABS(IDIGIT) DECIMAL DIGITS PER NUMBER.
C                 THE SUBPROGRAM WILL CHOOSE THAT INTEGER 4,6,10, OR 14
C                 WHICH WILL PRINT AT LEAST ABS(IDIGIT) NUMBER OF
C                 PLACES.  IF IDIGIT.LT.0, 72 PRINTING COLUMNS ARE
C                 UTILIZED TO WRITE EACH LINE OF OUTPUT OF THE ARRAY
C                 A(*,*). (THIS CAN BE USED ON MOST TIME-SHARING
C                 TERMINALS).  IF IDIGIT.GE.0, 133 PRINTING COLUMNS ARE
C                 UTILIZED. (THIS CAN BE USED ON MOST LINE PRINTERS).
C
C  EXAMPLE..
C
C  PRINT AN ARRAY CALLED (SIMPLEX TABLEAU   ) OF SIZE 10 BY 20 SHOWING
C  6 DECIMAL DIGITS PER NUMBER. THE USER IS RUNNING ON A TIME-SHARING
C  SYSTEM WITH A 72 COLUMN OUTPUT DEVICE.
C
C     DIMENSION TABLEU(20,20)
C     M = 10
C     N = 20
C     LDTABL = 20
C     IDIGIT = -6
C     CALL SMOUT(M,N,LDTABL,TABLEU,21H(16H1SIMPLEX TABLEAU),IDIGIT)
