C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Given a NONSYMMETRIC TRIDIAGONAL matrix such that the products
C     of corresponding pairs of off-diagonal elements are all
C     non-negative, and zero only when both factors are zero, this
C     subroutine reduces it to a SYMMETRIC TRIDIAGONAL matrix
C     using and accumulating diagonal similarity transformations.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional
C          array parameters, T and Z, as declared in the calling
C          program dimension statement.  NM is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix T.  N is an INTEGER variable.
C          N must be less than or equal to NM.
C
C        T contains the nonsymmetric matrix.  Its subdiagonal is
C          stored in the last N-1 positions of the first column,
C          its diagonal in the N positions of the second column,
C          and its superdiagonal in the first N-1 positions of
C          the third column.  T(1,1) and T(N,3) are arbitrary.
C          T is a two-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned T(NM,3).
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        T is unaltered.
C
C        D contains the diagonal elements of the tridiagonal symmetric
C          matrix.  D is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned D(N).
C
C        E contains the subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
C          symmetric matrix in its last N-1 positions.  E(1) is not set.
C          E is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned E(N).
C
C        Z contains the diagonal transformation matrix produced in the
C          symmetrization.  Z is a two-dimensional REAL array,
C          dimensioned Z(NM,N).
C
C        IERR is an INTEGER flag set to
C          Zero       for normal return,
C          N+I        if T(I,1)*T(I-1,3) is negative,
C          2*N+I      if T(I,1)*T(I-1,3) is zero with one factor
C                     non-zero.  In these cases, there does not exist
C                     a symmetrizing similarity transformation which
C                     is essential for the validity of the later
C                     eigenvector computation.
