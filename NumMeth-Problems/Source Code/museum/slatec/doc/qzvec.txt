C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is the optional fourth step of the QZ algorithm
C     for solving generalized matrix eigenvalue problems,
C     SIAM J. NUMER. ANAL. 10, 241-256(1973) by MOLER and STEWART.
C
C     This subroutine accepts a pair of REAL matrices, one of them in
C     quasi-triangular form (in which each 2-by-2 block corresponds to
C     a pair of complex eigenvalues) and the other in upper triangular
C     form.  It computes the eigenvectors of the triangular problem and
C     transforms the results back to the original coordinate system.
C     It is usually preceded by  QZHES,  QZIT, and  QZVAL.
C
C     On Input
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional
C          array parameters, A, B, and Z, as declared in the calling
C          program dimension statement.  NM is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        N is the order of the matrices A and B.  N is an INTEGER
C          variable.  N must be less than or equal to NM.
C
C        A contains a real upper quasi-triangular matrix.  A is a two-
C          dimensional REAL array, dimensioned A(NM,N).
C
C        B contains a real upper triangular matrix.  In addition,
C          location B(N,1) contains the tolerance quantity (EPSB)
C          computed and saved in  QZIT.  B is a two-dimensional REAL
C          array, dimensioned B(NM,N).
C
C        ALFR, ALFI, and BETA are one-dimensional REAL arrays with
C          components whose ratios ((ALFR+I*ALFI)/BETA) are the
C          generalized eigenvalues.  They are usually obtained from
C          QZVAL.  They are dimensioned ALFR(N), ALFI(N), and BETA(N).
C
C        Z contains the transformation matrix produced in the reductions
C          by  QZHES,  QZIT, and  QZVAL,  if performed.  If the
C          eigenvectors of the triangular problem are desired, Z must
C          contain the identity matrix.  Z is a two-dimensional REAL
C          array, dimensioned Z(NM,N).
C
C     On Output
C
C        A is unaltered.  Its subdiagonal elements provide information
C           about the storage of the complex eigenvectors.
C
C        B has been destroyed.
C
C        ALFR, ALFI, and BETA are unaltered.
C
C        Z contains the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvectors.
C          If ALFI(J) .EQ. 0.0, the J-th eigenvalue is real and
C            the J-th column of Z contains its eigenvector.
C          If ALFI(J) .NE. 0.0, the J-th eigenvalue is complex.
C            If ALFI(J) .GT. 0.0, the eigenvalue is the first of
C              a complex pair and the J-th and (J+1)-th columns
C              of Z contain its eigenvector.
C            If ALFI(J) .LT. 0.0, the eigenvalue is the second of
C              a complex pair and the (J-1)-th and J-th columns
C              of Z contain the conjugate of its eigenvector.
C          Each eigenvector is normalized so that the modulus
C          of its largest component is 1.0 .
