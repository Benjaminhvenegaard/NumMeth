C***PURPOSE  To provide single-precision floating-point arithmetic
C            with an extended exponent range.
C***LIBRARY   SLATEC
C***CATEGORY  A3D
C***TYPE      SINGLE PRECISION (XC210-S, DXC210-D)

C***DESCRIPTION
C     INTEGER K, J
C     REAL Z
C
C                  GIVEN K THIS SUBROUTINE COMPUTES J AND Z
C                  SUCH THAT  RADIX**K = Z*10**J, WHERE Z IS IN
C                  THE RANGE 1/10 .LE. Z .LT. 1.
C                  THE VALUE OF Z WILL BE ACCURATE TO FULL
C                  SINGLE-PRECISION PROVIDED THE NUMBER
C                  OF DECIMAL PLACES IN THE LARGEST
C                  INTEGER PLUS THE NUMBER OF DECIMAL
C                  PLACES CARRIED IN SINGLE-PRECISION DOES NOT
C                  EXCEED 60. XC210 IS CALLED BY SUBROUTINE
C                  XCON WHEN NECESSARY. THE USER SHOULD
C                  NEVER NEED TO CALL XC210 DIRECTLY.
