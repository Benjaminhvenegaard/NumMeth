C     Abstract
C         BINT4 computes the B representation (T,BCOEF,N,K) of a
C         cubic spline (K=4) which interpolates data (X(I)),Y(I))),
C         I=1,NDATA.  Parameters IBCL, IBCR, FBCL, FBCR allow the
C         specification of the spline first or second derivative at
C         both X(1) and X(NDATA).  When this data is not specified
C         by the problem, it is common practice to use a natural
C         spline by setting second derivatives at X(1) and X(NDATA)
C         to zero (IBCL=IBCR=2,FBCL=FBCR=0.0).  The spline is defined on
C         T(4) .LE. X .LE. T(N+1) with (ordered) interior knots at X(I))
C         values where N=NDATA+2.  The knots T(1), T(2), T(3) lie to
C         the left of T(4)=X(1) and the knots T(N+2), T(N+3), T(N+4)
C         lie to the right of T(N+1)=X(NDATA) in increasing order.  If
C         no extrapolation outside (X(1),X(NDATA)) is anticipated, the
C         knots T(1)=T(2)=T(3)=T(4)=X(1) and T(N+2)=T(N+3)=T(N+4)=
C         T(N+1)=X(NDATA) can be specified by KNTOPT=1.  KNTOPT=2
C         selects a knot placement for T(1), T(2), T(3) to make the
C         first 7 knots symmetric about T(4)=X(1) and similarly for
C         T(N+2), T(N+3), T(N+4) about T(N+1)=X(NDATA).  KNTOPT=3
C         allows the user to make his own selection, in increasing
C         order, for T(1), T(2), T(3) to the left of X(1) and T(N+2),
C         T(N+3), T(N+4) to the right of X(NDATA) in the work array
C         W(1) through W(6).  In any case, the interpolation on
C         T(4) .LE. X .LE. T(N+1) by using function BVALU is unique
C         for given boundary conditions.
