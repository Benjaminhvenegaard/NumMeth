C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is called to set up Brent's 'mp' package
C     for use by the extended precision inner products from the BLAS.
C
C     In the SLATEC library we require the Extended Precision MP number
C     to have a mantissa twice as long as Double Precision numbers.
C     The calculation of MPT (and MPMXR which is the actual array size)
C     in this routine will give 2x (or slightly more) on the machine
C     that we are running on.  The INTEGER array size of 30 was chosen
C     to be slightly longer than the longest INTEGER array needed on
C     any machine that we are currently aware of.
