C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure ELMTRANS,
C     NUM. MATH. 16, 181-204(1970) by Peters and Wilkinson.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 372-395(1971).
C
C     This subroutine accumulates the stabilized elementary
C     similarity transformations used in the reduction of a
C     REAL GENERAL matrix to upper Hessenberg form by  ELMHES.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional
C          array parameters, A and Z, as declared in the calling
C          program dimension statement.  NM is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix A.  N is an INTEGER variable.
C          N must be less than or equal to NM.
C
C        LOW and IGH are two INTEGER variables determined by the
C          balancing subroutine  BALANC.  If  BALANC  has not been
C          used, set LOW=1 and IGH equal to the order of the matrix, N.
C
C        A contains the multipliers which were used in the reduction
C          by  ELMHES  in its lower triangle below the subdiagonal.
C          A is a two-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned A(NM,IGH).
C
C        INT contains information on the rows and columns interchanged
C          in the reduction by  ELMHES.  Only elements LOW through IGH
C          are used.  INT is a one-dimensional INTEGER array,
C          dimensioned INT(IGH).
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        Z contains the transformation matrix produced in the reduction
C          by  ELMHES.  Z is a two-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned
C          Z(NM,N).
