C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure BALANCE,
C     NUM. MATH. 13, 293-304(1969) by Parlett and Reinsch.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., Vol.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 315-326(1971).
C
C     This subroutine balances a REAL matrix and isolates
C     eigenvalues whenever possible.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional
C          array parameter, A, as declared in the calling program
C          dimension statement.  NM is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix A.  N is an INTEGER variable.
C          N must be less than or equal to NM.
C
C        A contains the input matrix to be balanced.  A is a
C          two-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned A(NM,N).
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        A contains the balanced matrix.
C
C        LOW and IGH are two INTEGER variables such that A(I,J)
C          is equal to zero if
C           (1) I is greater than J and
C           (2) J=1,...,LOW-1 or I=IGH+1,...,N.
C
C        SCALE contains information determining the permutations and
C          scaling factors used.  SCALE is a one-dimensional REAL array,
C          dimensioned SCALE(N).
C
C     Suppose that the principal submatrix in rows LOW through IGH
C     has been balanced, that P(J) denotes the index interchanged
C     with J during the permutation step, and that the elements
C     of the diagonal matrix used are denoted by D(I,J).  Then
C        SCALE(J) = P(J),    for J = 1,...,LOW-1
C                 = D(J,J),      J = LOW,...,IGH
C                 = P(J)         J = IGH+1,...,N.
C     The order in which the interchanges are made is N to IGH+1,
C     then 1 TO LOW-1.
C
C     Note that 1 is returned for IGH if IGH is zero formally.
C
C     The ALGOL procedure EXC contained in BALANCE appears in
C     BALANC  in line.  (Note that the ALGOL roles of identifiers
C     K,L have been reversed.)
