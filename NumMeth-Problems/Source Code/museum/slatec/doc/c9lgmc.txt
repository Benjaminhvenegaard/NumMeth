C***PURPOSE  Compute the log gamma correction factor so that
C            LOG(CGAMMA(Z)) = 0.5*LOG(2.*PI) + (Z-0.5)*LOG(Z) - Z
C            + C9LGMC(Z).

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C Compute the LOG GAMMA correction term for large ABS(Z) when REAL(Z)
C .GE. 0.0 and for large ABS(AIMAG(Y)) when REAL(Z) .LT. 0.0.  We find
C C9LGMC so that
C   LOG(Z) = 0.5*LOG(2.*PI) + (Z-0.5)*LOG(Z) - Z + C9LGMC(Z)
