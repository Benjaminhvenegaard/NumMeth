C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  BNSLV is the BANSLV routine from
C        * A Practical Guide to Splines *  by C. de Boor
C
C  Companion routine to  BNFAC . It returns the solution  X  of the
C  linear system  A*X = B  in place of  B , given the LU-factorization
C  for  A  in the work array  W from BNFAC.

C  W, NROWW,NROW,NBANDL,NBANDU.....Describe the LU-factorization of a
C        banded matrix  A  of order  NROW  as constructed in  BNFAC .
C        For details, see  BNFAC .

C     (With  A = L*U, as stored in  W,) the unit lower triangular system
C  L(U*X) = B  is solved for  Y = U*X, and  Y  stored in  B . Then the
C  upper triangular system  U*X = Y  is solved for  X  . The calcul-
C  ations are so arranged that the innermost loops stay within columns.
