C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Abstract    **** a double precision routine ****
C
C         DBSQAD computes the integral on (X1,X2) of a K-th order
C         B-spline using the B-representation (T,BCOEF,N,K).  Orders
C         K as high as 20 are permitted by applying a 2, 6, or 10
C         point Gauss formula on subintervals of (X1,X2) which are
C         formed by included (distinct) knots.
C
C         If orders K greater than 20 are needed, use DBFQAD with
C         F(X) = 1.
C
C         The maximum number of significant digits obtainable in
C         DBSQAD is the smaller of 18 and the number of digits
C         carried in double precision arithmetic.
