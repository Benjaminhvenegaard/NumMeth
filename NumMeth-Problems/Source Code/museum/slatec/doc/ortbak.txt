C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure ORTBAK,
C     NUM. MATH. 12, 349-368(1968) by Martin and Wilkinson.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 339-358(1971).
C
C     This subroutine forms the eigenvectors of a REAL GENERAL
C     matrix by back transforming those of the corresponding
C     upper Hessenberg matrix determined by  ORTHES.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional
C          array parameters, A and Z, as declared in the calling
C          program dimension statement.  NM is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        LOW and IGH are two INTEGER variables determined by the
C          balancing subroutine  BALANC.  If  BALANC  has not been
C          used, set LOW=1 and IGH equal to the order of the matrix.
C
C        A contains some information about the orthogonal trans-
C          formations used in the reduction to Hessenberg form by
C          ORTHES  in its strict lower triangle.  A is a two-dimensional
C          REAL array, dimensioned A(NM,IGH).
C
C        ORT contains further information about the orthogonal trans-
C          formations used in the reduction by  ORTHES.  Only elements
C          LOW through IGH are used.  ORT is a one-dimensional REAL
C          array, dimensioned ORT(IGH).
C
C        M is the number of columns of Z to be back transformed.
C          M is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        Z contains the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvectors to
C          be back transformed in its first M columns.  Z is a two-
C          dimensional REAL array, dimensioned Z(NM,M).
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        Z contains the real and imaginary parts of the transformed
C          eigenvectors in its first M columns.
C
C        ORT has been used for temporary storage as is not restored.
C
C     NOTE that ORTBAK preserves vector Euclidean norms.
