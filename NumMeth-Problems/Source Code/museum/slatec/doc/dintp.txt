C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   The methods in subroutine  DSTEPS  approximate the solution near  X
C   by a polynomial.  Subroutine  DINTP  approximates the solution at
C   XOUT  by evaluating the polynomial there.  Information defining this
C   polynomial is passed from  DSTEPS  so  DINTP  cannot be used alone.
C
C   Subroutine DSTEPS is completely explained and documented in the text
C   "Computer Solution of Ordinary Differential Equations, the Initial
C   Value Problem"  by L. F. Shampine and M. K. Gordon.
C
C   Input to DINTP --
C
C   The user provides storage in the calling program for the arrays in
C   the call list
C      DIMENSION Y(NEQN),YOUT(NEQN),YPOUT(NEQN),PHI(NEQN,16),OY(NEQN)
C                AND ALPHA(12),OG(13),OW(12),GI(11),IV(10)
C   and defines
C      XOUT -- point at which solution is desired.
C   The remaining parameters are defined in  DSTEPS  and passed to
C   DINTP  from that subroutine
C
C   Output from  DINTP --
C
C      YOUT(*) -- solution at  XOUT
C      YPOUT(*) -- derivative of solution at  XOUT
C   The remaining parameters are returned unaltered from their input
C   values.  Integration with  DSTEPS  may be continued.
