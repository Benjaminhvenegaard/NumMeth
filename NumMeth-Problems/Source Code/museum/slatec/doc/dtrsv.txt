C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  DTRSV  solves one of the systems of equations
C
C     A*x = b,   or   A'*x = b,
C
C  where b and x are n element vectors and A is an n by n unit, or
C  non-unit, upper or lower triangular matrix.
C
C  No test for singularity or near-singularity is included in this
C  routine. Such tests must be performed before calling this routine.
C
C  Parameters
C  ==========
C
C  UPLO   - CHARACTER*1.
C           On entry, UPLO specifies whether the matrix is an upper or
C           lower triangular matrix as follows:
C
C              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   A is an upper triangular matrix.
C
C              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   A is a lower triangular matrix.
C
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  TRANS  - CHARACTER*1.
C           On entry, TRANS specifies the equations to be solved as
C           follows:
C
C              TRANS = 'N' or 'n'   A*x = b.
C
C              TRANS = 'T' or 't'   A'*x = b.
C
C              TRANS = 'C' or 'c'   A'*x = b.
C
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  DIAG   - CHARACTER*1.
C           On entry, DIAG specifies whether or not A is unit
C           triangular as follows:
C
C              DIAG = 'U' or 'u'   A is assumed to be unit triangular.
C
C              DIAG = 'N' or 'n'   A is not assumed to be unit
C                                  triangular.
C
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  N      - INTEGER.
C           On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A.
C           N must be at least zero.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  A      - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION ( LDA, n).
C           Before entry with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the leading n by n
C           upper triangular part of the array A must contain the upper
C           triangular matrix and the strictly lower triangular part of
C           A is not referenced.
C           Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the leading n by n
C           lower triangular part of the array A must contain the lower
C           triangular matrix and the strictly upper triangular part of
C           A is not referenced.
C           Note that when  DIAG = 'U' or 'u', the diagonal elements of
C           A are not referenced either, but are assumed to be unity.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  LDA    - INTEGER.
C           On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
C           in the calling (sub) program. LDA must be at least
C           max( 1, n ).
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  X      - DOUBLE PRECISION array of dimension at least
C           ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCX ) ).
C           Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the n
C           element right-hand side vector b. On exit, X is overwritten
C           with the solution vector x.
C
C  INCX   - INTEGER.
C           On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of
C           X. INCX must not be zero.
C           Unchanged on exit.
