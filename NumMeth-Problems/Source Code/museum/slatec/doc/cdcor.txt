C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  In the case of functional iteration, update Y directly from the
C  result of the last call to F.
C  In the case of the chord method, compute the corrector error and
C  solve the linear system with that as right hand side and DFDY as
C  coefficient matrix, using the LU decomposition if MITER is 1, 2, 4,
C  or 5.
