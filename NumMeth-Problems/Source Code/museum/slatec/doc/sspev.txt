C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Abstract
C      SSPEV computes the eigenvalues and, optionally, the eigenvectors
C      of a real symmetric matrix stored in packed form.
C
C     Call Sequence Parameters-
C       (The values of parameters marked with * (star) will be  changed
C         by SSPEV.)
C
C        A*      REAL(N*(N+1)/2)
C                real symmetric packed input matrix.  Contains upper
C                triangle and diagonal of A, by column (elements
C                11, 12, 22, 13, 23, 33, ...).
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                set by the user to
C                the order of the matrix A.
C
C        E*      REAL(N)
C                on return from SSPEV, E contains the eigenvalues of A.
C                See also INFO below.
C
C        V*      REAL(LDV,N)
C                on return from SSPEV, if the user has set JOB
C                = 0        V is not referenced.
C                = nonzero  the N eigenvectors of A are stored in the
C                first N columns of V.  See also INFO below.
C
C        LDV     INTEGER
C                set by the user to
C                the leading dimension of the array V if JOB is also
C                set nonzero.  In that case, N must be .LE. LDV.
C                If JOB is set to zero, LDV is not referenced.
C
C        WORK*   REAL(2N)
C                temporary storage vector.  Contents changed by SSPEV.
C
C        JOB     INTEGER
C                set by the user to
C                = 0        eigenvalues only to be calculated by SSPEV.
C                           Neither V nor LDV are referenced.
C                = nonzero  eigenvalues and vectors to be calculated.
C                           In this case, A & V must be distinct arrays.
C                           Also, if LDA .GT. LDV, SSPEV changes all the
C                           elements of A thru column N.  If LDA < LDV,
C                           SSPEV changes all the elements of V through
C                           column N.  If LDA=LDV, only A(I,J) and V(I,
C                           J) for I,J = 1,...,N are changed by SSPEV.
C
C       INFO*   INTEGER
C               on return from SSPEV, the value of INFO is
C               = 0 for normal return.
C               = K if the eigenvalue iteration fails to converge.
C                   Eigenvalues and vectors 1 through K-1 are correct.
C
C
C     Error Messages-
C          No. 1   recoverable  N is greater than LDV and JOB is nonzero
C          No. 2   recoverable  N is less than one
