C***DESCRIPTION

C     Abstract
C         BFQAD computes the integral on (X1,X2) of a product of a
C         function F and the ID-th derivative of a K-th order B-spline,
C         using the B-representation (T,BCOEF,N,K).  (X1,X2) must be
C         a subinterval of T(K) .LE. X .le. T(N+1).  An integration
C         routine BSGQ8 (a modification
C         of GAUS8), integrates the product on sub-
C         intervals of (X1,X2) formed by included (distinct) knots.

C     Description of Arguments
C         Input
C           F      - external function of one argument for the
C                    integrand BF(X)=F(X)*BVALU(T,BCOEF,N,K,ID,X,INBV,
C                    WORK)
C           T      - knot array of length N+K
C           BCOEF  - coefficient array of length N
C           N      - length of coefficient array
C           K      - order of B-spline, K .GE. 1
C           ID     - order of the spline derivative, 0 .LE. ID .LE. K-1
C                    ID=0 gives the spline function
C           X1,X2  - end points of quadrature interval in
C                    T(K) .LE. X .LE. T(N+1)
C           TOL    - desired accuracy for the quadrature, suggest
C                    10.*STOL .LT. TOL .LE. 0.1 where STOL is the single
C                    precision unit roundoff for the machine = R1MACH(4)
C
C         Output
C           QUAD   - integral of BF(X) on (X1,X2)
C           IERR   - a status code
C                    IERR=1  normal return
C                         2  some quadrature on (X1,X2) does not meet
C                            the requested tolerance.
C           WORK   - work vector of length 3*K
C
C     Error Conditions
C         X1 or X2 not in T(K) .LE. X .LE. T(N+1) is a fatal error.
C         TOL not greater than the single precision unit roundoff or
C         less than 0.1 is a fatal error.
C         Some quadrature fails to meet the requested tolerance.
