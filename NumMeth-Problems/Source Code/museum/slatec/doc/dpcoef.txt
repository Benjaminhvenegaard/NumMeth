C***DESCRIPTION

C     Abstract
C
C     DPOLFT  computes the least squares polynomial fit of degree  L  as
C     a sum of orthogonal polynomials.  DPCOEF  changes this fit to its
C     Taylor expansion about any point  C , i.e. writes the polynomial
C     as a sum of powers of (X-C).  Taking  C=0.  gives the polynomial
C     in powers of X, but a suitable non-zero  C  often leads to
C     polynomials which are better scaled and more accurately evaluated.

C     The parameters for  DPCOEF  are

C     INPUT -- All TYPE REAL variables are DOUBLE PRECISION
C         L -      Indicates the degree of polynomial to be changed to
C                  its Taylor expansion.  To obtain the Taylor
C                  coefficients in reverse order, input  L  as the
C                  negative of the degree desired.  The absolute value
C                  of L  must be less than or equal to NDEG, the highest
C                  degree polynomial fitted by  DPOLFT .
C         C -      The point about which the Taylor expansion is to be
C                  made.
C         A -      Work and output array containing values from last
C                  call to  DPOLFT .

C     OUTPUT -- All TYPE REAL variables are DOUBLE PRECISION
C         TC -     Vector containing the first LL+1 Taylor coefficients
C                  where LL=ABS(L).  If  L.GT.0 , the coefficients are
C                  in the usual Taylor series order, i.e.
C                    P(X) = TC(1) + TC(2)*(X-C) + ... + TC(N+1)*(X-C)**N
C                  If L .LT. 0, the coefficients are in reverse order,
C                  i.e.
C                    P(X) = TC(1)*(X-C)**N + ... + TC(N)*(X-C) + TC(N+1)
