C***DESCRIPTION
C
C Pack a base 2 exponent into floating point number Y.  This
C routine is almost the inverse of R9UPAK.  It is not exactly
C the inverse, because ABS(X) need not be between 0.5 and
C 1.0.  If both R9PAK and 2.0**N were known to be in range, we
C could compute
C       R9PAK = Y * 2.0**N .
