C***SUBSIDIARY
C***PURPOSE  Interpolation routine for DDASSL.
C***LIBRARY   SLATEC (DASSL)
C***TYPE      DOUBLE PRECISION (SDATRP-S, DDATRP-D)
C***AUTHOR  Petzold, Linda R., (LLNL)
C***DESCRIPTION
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C     THE METHODS IN SUBROUTINE DDASTP USE POLYNOMIALS
C     TO APPROXIMATE THE SOLUTION. DDATRP APPROXIMATES THE
C     SOLUTION AND ITS DERIVATIVE AT TIME XOUT BY EVALUATING
C     ONE OF THESE POLYNOMIALS, AND ITS DERIVATIVE,THERE.
C     INFORMATION DEFINING THIS POLYNOMIAL IS PASSED FROM
C     DDASTP, SO DDATRP CANNOT BE USED ALONE.
C
C     THE PARAMETERS ARE:
C     X     THE CURRENT TIME IN THE INTEGRATION.
C     XOUT  THE TIME AT WHICH THE SOLUTION IS DESIRED
C     YOUT  THE INTERPOLATED APPROXIMATION TO Y AT XOUT
C           (THIS IS OUTPUT)
C     YPOUT THE INTERPOLATED APPROXIMATION TO YPRIME AT XOUT
C           (THIS IS OUTPUT)
C     NEQ   NUMBER OF EQUATIONS
C     KOLD  ORDER USED ON LAST SUCCESSFUL STEP
C     PHI   ARRAY OF SCALED DIVIDED DIFFERENCES OF Y
C     PSI   ARRAY OF PAST STEPSIZE HISTORY
