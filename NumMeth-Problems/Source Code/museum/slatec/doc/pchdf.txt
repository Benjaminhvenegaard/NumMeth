C***DESCRIPTION
C
C          PCHDF:   PCHIP Finite Difference Formula
C
C     Uses a divided difference formulation to compute a K-point approx-
C     imation to the derivative at X(K) based on the data in X and S.
C
C     Called by  PCHCE  and  PCHSP  to compute 3- and 4-point boundary
C     derivative approximations.

C     On input:
C        K      is the order of the desired derivative approximation.
C               K must be at least 3 (error return if not).
C        X      contains the K values of the independent variable.
C               X need not be ordered, but the values **MUST** be
C               distinct.  (Not checked here.)
C        S      contains the associated slope values:
C                  S(I) = (F(I+1)-F(I))/(X(I+1)-X(I)), I=1(1)K-1.
C               (Note that S need only be of length K-1.)
C
C     On return:
C        S      will be destroyed.
C        IERR   will be set to -1 if K.LT.2 .
C        PCHDF  will be set to the desired derivative approximation if
C               IERR=0 or to zero if IERR=-1.
