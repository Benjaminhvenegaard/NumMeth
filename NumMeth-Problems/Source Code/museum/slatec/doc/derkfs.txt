C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Fehlberg Fourth-Fifth order Runge-Kutta Method
C **********************************************************************
C
C     DERKFS integrates a system of first order ordinary differential
C     equations as described in the comments for DERKF .
C
C     The arrays YP,F1,F2,F3,F4,F5,and YS  (of length at least NEQ)
C     appear in the call list for variable dimensioning purposes.
C
C     The variables H,TOLFAC,TOLD,DTSIGN,U26,RER,INIT,KSTEPS,KOP,IQUIT,
C     STIFF,NONSTF,NTSTEP, and NSTIFS are used internally by the code
C     and appear in the call list to eliminate local retention of
C     variables between calls. Accordingly, these variables and the
C     array YP should not be altered.
C     Items of possible interest are
C         H  - An appropriate step size to be used for the next step
C         TOLFAC - Factor of change in the tolerances
C         YP - Derivative of solution vector at T
C         KSTEPS - Counter on the number of steps attempted
