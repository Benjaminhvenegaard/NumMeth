C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine computes required cosine values in ascending
C     order.  When IJUMP .GT. 1 the routine computes values
C
C        2*COS(J*PI/L) , J=1,2,...,L and J .NE. 0(MOD N/IJUMP+1)
C
C     where L = IJUMP*(N/IJUMP+1).
C
C
C     when IJUMP = 1 it computes
C
C            2*COS((J-FNUM)*PI/(N+FDEN)) ,  J=1, 2, ... ,N
C
C     where
C        FNUM = 0.5, FDEN = 0.0, for regular reduction values.
C        FNUM = 0.0, FDEN = 1.0, for B-R and C-R when ISTAG = 1
C        FNUM = 0.0, FDEN = 0.5, for B-R and C-R when ISTAG = 2
C        FNUM = 0.5, FDEN = 0.5, for B-R and C-R when ISTAG = 2
C                                in POISN2 only.
