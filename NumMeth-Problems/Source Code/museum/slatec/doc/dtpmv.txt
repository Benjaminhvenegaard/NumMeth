C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  DTPMV  performs one of the matrix-vector operations
C
C     x := A*x,   or   x := A'*x,
C
C  where x is an n element vector and  A is an n by n unit, or non-unit,
C  upper or lower triangular matrix, supplied in packed form.
C
C  Parameters
C  ==========
C
C  UPLO   - CHARACTER*1.
C           On entry, UPLO specifies whether the matrix is an upper or
C           lower triangular matrix as follows:
C
C              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   A is an upper triangular matrix.
C
C              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   A is a lower triangular matrix.
C
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  TRANS  - CHARACTER*1.
C           On entry, TRANS specifies the operation to be performed as
C           follows:
C
C              TRANS = 'N' or 'n'   x := A*x.
C
C              TRANS = 'T' or 't'   x := A'*x.
C
C              TRANS = 'C' or 'c'   x := A'*x.
C
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  DIAG   - CHARACTER*1.
C           On entry, DIAG specifies whether or not A is unit
C           triangular as follows:
C
C              DIAG = 'U' or 'u'   A is assumed to be unit triangular.
C
C              DIAG = 'N' or 'n'   A is not assumed to be unit
C                                  triangular.
C
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  N      - INTEGER.
C           On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A.
C           N must be at least zero.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  AP     - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION at least
C           ( ( n*( n + 1))/2).
C           Before entry with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the array AP must
C           contain the upper triangular matrix packed sequentially,
C           column by column, so that AP( 1 ) contains a( 1, 1 ),
C           AP( 2 ) and AP( 3 ) contain a( 1, 2 ) and a( 2, 2 )
C           respectively, and so on.
C           Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the array AP must
C           contain the lower triangular matrix packed sequentially,
C           column by column, so that AP( 1 ) contains a( 1, 1 ),
C           AP( 2 ) and AP( 3 ) contain a( 2, 1 ) and a( 3, 1 )
C           respectively, and so on.
C           Note that when  DIAG = 'U' or 'u', the diagonal elements of
C           A are not referenced, but are assumed to be unity.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  X      - DOUBLE PRECISION array of dimension at least
C           ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCX ) ).
C           Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the n
C           element vector x. On exit, X is overwritten with the
C           transformed vector x.
C
C  INCX   - INTEGER.
C           On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of
C           X. INCX must not be zero.
C           Unchanged on exit.
