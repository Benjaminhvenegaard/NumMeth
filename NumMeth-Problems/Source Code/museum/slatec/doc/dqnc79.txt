C***DESCRIPTION

C     Abstract  *** a DOUBLE PRECISION routine ***
C       DQNC79 is a general purpose program for evaluation of
C       one dimensional integrals of user defined functions.
C       DQNC79 will pick its own points for evaluation of the
C       integrand and these will vary from problem to problem.
C       Thus, DQNC79 is not designed to integrate over data sets.
C       Moderately smooth integrands will be integrated efficiently
C       and reliably.  For problems with strong singularities,
C       oscillations etc., the user may wish to use more sophis-
C       ticated routines such as those in QUADPACK.  One measure
C       of the reliability of DQNC79 is the output parameter K,
C       giving the number of integrand evaluations that were needed.

C     Description of Arguments
C
C     --Input--* FUN, A, B, ERR are DOUBLE PRECISION *
C       FUN  - name of external function to be integrated.  This name
C              must be in an EXTERNAL statement in your calling
C              program.  You must write a Fortran function to evaluate
C              FUN.  This should be of the form
C                    DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION FUN (X)
C              C
C              C     X can vary from A to B
C              C     FUN(X) should be finite for all X on interval.
C              C
C                    FUN = ...
C                    RETURN
C                    END
C       A    - lower limit of integration
C       B    - upper limit of integration (may be less than A)
C       ERR  - is a requested error tolerance.  Normally, pick a value
C              0 .LT. ERR .LT. 1.0D-8.
C
C     --Output--
C       ANS  - computed value of the integral.  Hopefully, ANS is
C              accurate to within ERR * integral of ABS(FUN(X)).
C       IERR - a status code
C            - Normal codes
C               1  ANS most likely meets requested error tolerance.
C              -1  A equals B, or A and B are too nearly equal to
C                  allow normal integration.  ANS is set to zero.
C            - Abnormal code
C               2  ANS probably does not meet requested error tolerance.
C       K    - the number of function evaluations actually used to do
C              the integration.  A value of K .GT. 1000 indicates a
C              difficult problem; other programs may be more efficient.
C              DQNC79 will gracefully give up if K exceeds 2000.
