C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     DPINTM LIMITS THE TYPE OF STORAGE TO A SEQUENTIAL SCHEME.
C     THE MATRIX IS STORED BY COLUMNS.
C     SPARSE MATRIX INITIALIZATION SUBROUTINE.
C
C            M=NUMBER OF ROWS OF THE MATRIX.
C            N=NUMBER OF COLUMNS OF THE MATRIX.
C  SX(*),IX(*)=THE WORK ARRAYS WHICH ARE USED TO STORE THE SPARSE
C              MATRIX.  THESE ARRAYS ARE AUTOMATICALLY MAINTAINED BY
C              THE PACKAGE FOR THE USER.
C          LMX=LENGTH OF THE WORK ARRAY SX(*).
C              LMX MUST BE AT LEAST N+7 WHERE
C              FOR GREATEST EFFICIENCY LMX SHOULD BE AT LEAST N+NZ+6
C              WHERE NZ IS THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF NONZEROES TO BE
C              STORED IN THE MATRIX.  VALUES OF LMX BETWEEN N+7 AND
C              N+NZ+6 WILL CAUSE DEMAND PAGING TO OCCUR.
C              THIS IS IMPLEMENTED BY THE PACKAGE.
C              IX(*) MUST BE DIMENSIONED AT LEAST LMX
C      IPAGEF=UNIT NUMBER WHERE DEMAND PAGES WILL BE STORED.
