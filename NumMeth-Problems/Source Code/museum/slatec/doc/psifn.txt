C***DESCRIPTION
C
C         The following definitions are used in PSIFN:
C
C      Definition 1
C         PSI(X) = d/dx (ln(GAMMA(X)), the first derivative of
C                  the LOG GAMMA function.
C      Definition 2
C                     K   K
C         PSI(K,X) = d /dx (PSI(X)), the K-th derivative of PSI(X).
C   ___________________________________________________________________
C       PSIFN computes a sequence of SCALED derivatives of
C       the PSI function; i.e. for fixed X and M it computes
C       the M-member sequence
C
C                  ((-1)**(K+1)/GAMMA(K+1))*PSI(K,X)
C                    for K = N,...,N+M-1
C
C       where PSI(K,X) is as defined above.   For KODE=1, PSIFN returns
C       the scaled derivatives as described.  KODE=2 is operative only
C       when K=0 and in that case PSIFN returns -PSI(X) + LN(X).  That
C       is, the logarithmic behavior for large X is removed when KODE=1
C       and K=0.  When sums or differences of PSI functions are computed
C       the logarithmic terms can be combined analytically and computed
C       separately to help retain significant digits.
C
C         Note that CALL PSIFN(X,0,1,1,ANS) results in
C                   ANS = -PSI(X)
C
C     Input
C           X      - Argument, X .gt. 0.0E0
C           N      - First member of the sequence, 0 .le. N .le. 100
C                    N=0 gives ANS(1) = -PSI(X)       for KODE=1
C                                       -PSI(X)+LN(X) for KODE=2
C           KODE   - Selection parameter
C                    KODE=1 returns scaled derivatives of the PSI
C                    function.
C                    KODE=2 returns scaled derivatives of the PSI
C                    function EXCEPT when N=0. In this case,
C                    ANS(1) = -PSI(X) + LN(X) is returned.
C           M      - Number of members of the sequence, M .ge. 1
C
C    Output
C           ANS    - A vector of length at least M whose first M
C                    components contain the sequence of derivatives
C                    scaled according to KODE.
C           NZ     - Underflow flag
C                    NZ.eq.0, A normal return
C                    NZ.ne.0, Underflow, last NZ components of ANS are
C                             set to zero, ANS(M-K+1)=0.0, K=1,...,NZ
C           IERR   - Error flag
C                    IERR=0, A normal return, computation completed
C                    IERR=1, Input error,     no computation
C                    IERR=2, Overflow,        X too small or N+M-1 too
C                            large or both
C                    IERR=3, Error,           N too large. Dimensioned
C                            array TRMR(NMAX) is not large enough for N
C
C         The nominal computational accuracy is the maximum of unit
C         roundoff (=R1MACH(4)) and 1.0E-18 since critical constants
C         are given to only 18 digits.
C
C         DPSIFN is the Double Precision version of PSIFN.
C
C *Long Description:
C
C         The basic method of evaluation is the asymptotic expansion
C         for large X.ge.XMIN followed by backward recursion on a two
C         term recursion relation
C
C                  W(X+1) + X**(-N-1) = W(X).
C
C         This is supplemented by a series
C
C                  SUM( (X+K)**(-N-1) , K=0,1,2,... )
C
C         which converges rapidly for large N. Both XMIN and the
C         number of terms of the series are calculated from the unit
C         roundoff of the machine environment.
