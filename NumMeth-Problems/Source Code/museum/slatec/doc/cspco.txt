C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     CSPCO factors a complex symmetric matrix stored in packed
C     form by elimination with symmetric pivoting and estimates
C     the condition of the matrix.
C
C     If  RCOND  is not needed, CSPFA is slightly faster.
C     To solve  A*X = B , follow CSPCO by CSPSL.
C     To compute  INVERSE(A)*C , follow CSPCO by CSPSL.
C     To compute  INVERSE(A) , follow CSPCO by CSPDI.
C     To compute  DETERMINANT(A) , follow CSPCO by CSPDI.
C
C     On Entry
C
C        AP      COMPLEX (N*(N+1)/2)
C                the packed form of a symmetric matrix  A .  The
C                columns of the upper triangle are stored sequentially
C                in a one-dimensional array of length  N*(N+1)/2 .
C                See comments below for details.
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the matrix  A .
C
C     On Return
C
C        AP      a block diagonal matrix and the multipliers which
C                were used to obtain it stored in packed form.
C                The factorization can be written  A = U*D*TRANS(U)
C                where  U  is a product of permutation and unit
C                upper triangular matrices , TRANS(U) is the
C                transpose of  U , and  D  is block diagonal
C                with 1 by 1 and 2 by 2 blocks.
C
C        KVPT    INTEGER(N)
C                an integer vector of pivot indices.
C
C        RCOND   REAL
C                an estimate of the reciprocal condition of  A .
C                For the system  A*X = B , relative perturbations
C                in  A  and  B  of size  EPSILON  may cause
C                relative perturbations in  X  of size  EPSILON/RCOND .
C                If  RCOND  is so small that the logical expression
C                           1.0 + RCOND .EQ. 1.0
C                is true, then  A  may be singular to working
C                precision.  In particular,  RCOND  is zero  if
C                exact singularity is detected or the estimate
C                underflows.
C
C        Z       COMPLEX(N)
C                a work vector whose contents are usually unimportant.
C                If  A  is close to a singular matrix, then  Z  is
C                an approximate null vector in the sense that
C                NORM(A*Z) = RCOND*NORM(A)*NORM(Z) .
C
C     Packed Storage
C
C          The following program segment will pack the upper
C          triangle of a symmetric matrix.
C
C                K = 0
C                DO 20 J = 1, N
C                   DO 10 I = 1, J
C                      K = K + 1
C                      AP(K) = A(I,J)
C             10    CONTINUE
C             20 CONTINUE
