C     Abstract
C
C         BINTK is the SPLINT routine of the reference.
C
C         BINTK produces the B-spline coefficients, BCOEF, of the
C         B-spline of order K with knots T(I), I=1,...,N+K, which
C         takes on the value Y(I) at X(I), I=1,...,N.  The spline or
C         any of its derivatives can be evaluated by calls to BVALU.
C         The I-th equation of the linear system A*BCOEF = B for the
C         coefficients of the interpolant enforces interpolation at
C         X(I)), I=1,...,N.  Hence, B(I) = Y(I), all I, and A is
C         a band matrix with 2K-1 bands if A is invertible. The matrix
C         A is generated row by row and stored, diagonal by diagonal,
C         in the rows of Q, with the main diagonal going into row K.
C         The banded system is then solved by a call to BNFAC (which
C         constructs the triangular factorization for A and stores it
C         again in Q), followed by a call to BNSLV (which then
C         obtains the solution BCOEF by substitution). BNFAC does no
C         pivoting, since the total positivity of the matrix A makes
C         this unnecessary.  The linear system to be solved is
C         (theoretically) invertible if and only if
C                 T(I) .LT. X(I)) .LT. T(I+K),        all I.
C         Equality is permitted on the left for I=1 and on the right
C         for I=N when K knots are used at X(1) or X(N).  Otherwise,
C         violation of this condition is certain to lead to an error.

C     Description of Arguments
C         Input
C           X       - vector of length N containing data point abscissa
C                     in strictly increasing order.
C           Y       - corresponding vector of length N containing data
C                     point ordinates.
C           T       - knot vector of length N+K
C                     since T(1),..,T(K) .LE. X(1) and T(N+1),..,T(N+K)
C                     .GE. X(N), this leaves only N-K knots (not nec-
C                     essarily X(I)) values) interior to (X(1),X(N))
C           N       - number of data points, N .GE. K
C           K       - order of the spline, K .GE. 1
C
C         Output
C           BCOEF   - a vector of length N containing the B-spline
C                     coefficients
C           Q       - a work vector of length (2*K-1)*N, containing
C                     the triangular factorization of the coefficient
C                     matrix of the linear system being solved.  The
C                     coefficients for the interpolant of an
C                     additional data set (X(I)),YY(I)), I=1,...,N
C                     with the same abscissa can be obtained by loading
C                     YY into BCOEF and then executing
C                         CALL BNSLV (Q,2K-1,N,K-1,K-1,BCOEF)
C           WORK    - work vector of length 2*K
C
C     Error Conditions
C         Improper  input is a fatal error
C         Singular system of equations is a fatal error
