C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure BALBAK,
C     NUM. MATH. 13, 293-304(1969) by Parlett and Reinsch.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., Vol.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 315-326(1971).
C
C     This subroutine forms the eigenvectors of a REAL GENERAL
C     matrix by back transforming those of the corresponding
C     balanced matrix determined by  BALANC.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional
C          array parameter, Z, as declared in the calling program
C          dimension statement.  NM is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        N is the number of components of the vectors in matrix Z.
C          N is an INTEGER variable.  N must be less than or equal
C          to NM.
C
C        LOW and IGH are INTEGER variables determined by  BALANC.
C
C        SCALE contains information determining the permutations and
C          scaling factors used by  BALANC.  SCALE is a one-dimensional
C          REAL array, dimensioned SCALE(N).
C
C        M is the number of columns of Z to be back transformed.
C          M is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        Z contains the real and imaginary parts of the eigen-
C          vectors to be back transformed in its first M columns.
C          Z is a two-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned Z(NM,M).
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        Z contains the real and imaginary parts of the
C          transformed eigenvectors in its first M columns.
