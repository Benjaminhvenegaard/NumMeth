C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine calls the recommended sequence of
C     subroutines from the eigensystem subroutine package (EISPACK)
C     to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (if desired)
C     of a REAL SYMMETRIC BAND matrix.
C
C     On Input
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional
C          array parameters, A and Z, as declared in the calling
C          program dimension statement.  NM is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix A.  N is an INTEGER variable.
C          N must be less than or equal to NM.
C
C        MB is the half band width of the matrix, defined as the
C          number of adjacent diagonals, including the principal
C          diagonal, required to specify the non-zero portion of the
C          lower triangle of the matrix.  MB must be less than or
C          equal to N.  MB is an INTEGER variable.
C
C        A contains the lower triangle of the real symmetric band
C          matrix.  Its lowest subdiagonal is stored in the last
C          N+1-MB  positions of the first column, its next subdiagonal
C          in the last  N+2-MB  positions of the second column, further
C          subdiagonals similarly, and finally its principal diagonal
C          in the  N  positions of the last column.  Contents of storage
C          locations not part of the matrix are arbitrary.  A is a
C          two-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned A(NM,MB).
C
C        MATZ is an INTEGER variable set equal to zero if only
C          eigenvalues are desired.  Otherwise, it is set to any
C          non-zero integer for both eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
C
C     On Output
C
C        A has been destroyed.
C
C        W contains the eigenvalues in ascending order.  W is a one-
C          dimensional REAL array, dimensioned W(N).
C
C        Z contains the eigenvectors if MATZ is not zero.  The
C          eigenvectors are orthonormal.  Z is a two-dimensional
C          REAL array, dimensioned Z(NM,N).
C
C        IERR is an INTEGER flag set to
C          Zero       for normal return,
C          10*N       if N is greater than NM,
C          12*N       if MB is either non-positive or greater than N,
C          J          if the J-th eigenvalue has not been
C                     determined after 30 iterations.
C                     The eigenvalues and eigenvectors, if requested,
C                     should be correct for indices 1, 2, ..., IERR-1.
C
C        FV1 and FV2 are one-dimensional REAL arrays used for temporary
C          storage, dimensioned FV1(N) and FV2(N).
