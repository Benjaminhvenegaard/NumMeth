C***BEGIN PROLOGUE  DBHIN
C***PURPOSE  Read a Sparse Linear System in the Boeing/Harwell Format.
C            The matrix is read in and if the right hand side is also
C            present in the input file then it too is read in.  The
C            matrix is then modified to be in the SLAP Column format.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C *Usage:
C     INTEGER N, NELT, IA(NELT), JA(NELT), ISYM, IUNIT, JOB
C     DOUBLE PRECISION A(NELT), SOLN(N), RHS(N)
C
C     CALL DBHIN( N, NELT, IA, JA, A, ISYM, SOLN, RHS, IUNIT, JOB )
C
C *Arguments:
C N      :OUT      Integer
C         Order of the Matrix.
C NELT   :INOUT    Integer.
C         On input NELT is the maximum number of non-zeros that
C         can be stored in the IA, JA, A arrays.
C         On output NELT is the number of non-zeros stored in A.
C IA     :OUT      Integer IA(NELT).
C JA     :OUT      Integer JA(NELT).
C A      :OUT      Double Precision A(NELT).
C         On output these arrays hold the matrix A in the SLAP
C         Triad format.  See "Description", below.
C ISYM   :OUT      Integer.
C         Flag to indicate symmetric storage format.
C         If ISYM=0, all non-zero entries of the matrix are stored.
C         If ISYM=1, the matrix is symmetric, and only the lower
C         triangle of the matrix is stored.
C SOLN   :OUT      Double Precision SOLN(N).
C         The solution to the linear system, if present.  This array
C         is accessed if and only if JOB is set to read it in, see
C         below.  If the user requests that SOLN be read in, but it is
C         not in the file, then it is simply zeroed out.
C RHS    :OUT      Double Precision RHS(N).
C         The right hand side vector.  This array is accessed if and
C         only if JOB is set to read it in, see below.
C         If the user requests that RHS be read in, but it is not in
C         the file, then it is simply zeroed out.
C IUNIT  :IN       Integer.
C         Fortran logical I/O device unit number to read the matrix
C         from.  This unit must be connected in a system dependent
C         fashion to a file, or you will get a nasty message
C         from the Fortran I/O libraries.
C JOB    :INOUT    Integer.
C         Flag indicating what I/O operations to perform.
C         On input JOB indicates what Input operations to try to
C         perform.
C         JOB = 0 => Read only the matrix.
C         JOB = 1 => Read matrix and RHS (if present).
C         JOB = 2 => Read matrix and SOLN (if present).
C         JOB = 3 => Read matrix, RHS and SOLN (if present).
C         On output JOB indicates what operations were actually
C         performed.
C         JOB = -3 => Unable to parse matrix "CODE" from input file
C                     to determine if only the lower triangle of matrix
C                     is stored.
C         JOB = -2 => Number of non-zeros (NELT) too large.
C         JOB = -1 => System size (N) too large.
C         JOB =  0 => Read in only the matrix.
C         JOB =  1 => Read in the matrix and RHS.
C         JOB =  2 => Read in the matrix and SOLN.
C         JOB =  3 => Read in the matrix, RHS and SOLN.
C         JOB = 10 => Read in only the matrix *STRUCTURE*, but no
C                     non-zero entries.  Hence, A(*) is not referenced
C                     and has the return values the same as the input.
C         JOB = 11 => Read in the matrix *STRUCTURE* and RHS.
C         JOB = 12 => Read in the matrix *STRUCTURE* and SOLN.
C         JOB = 13 => Read in the matrix *STRUCTURE*, RHS and SOLN.
C
C *Description:
C       The format for the input is as follows.  The first line contains
C       a title to identify the data file.  On the second line (5I4) are
C       counters: NLINE, NPLS, NRILS, NNVLS, NRHSLS.
C        NLINE  Number of data lines (after the header) in the file.
C        NPLS   Number of lines for the Column Pointer data in the file.
C        NRILS  Number of lines for the Row indices in the file.
C        NNVLS  Number of lines for the Matrix elements in the file.
C        NRHSLS Number of lines for the RHS in the file.
C       The third line (A3,11X,4I4) contains a symmetry code and some
C       additional counters: CODE, NROW, NCOL, NIND, NELE.
C       On the fourth line (2A16,2A20) are formats to be used to read
C       the following data: PNTFNT, RINFMT, NVLFMT, RHSFMT.
C       Following that are the blocks of data in the order indicated.
C
C       =================== S L A P Triad format ===================
C       This routine requires that the  matrix A be   stored in  the
C       SLAP  Triad format.  In  this format only the non-zeros  are
C       stored.  They may appear in  *ANY* order.  The user supplies
C       three arrays of  length NELT, where  NELT is  the number  of
C       non-zeros in the matrix: (IA(NELT), JA(NELT), A(NELT)).  For
C       each non-zero the user puts the row and column index of that
C       matrix element  in the IA and  JA arrays.  The  value of the
C       non-zero  matrix  element is  placed   in  the corresponding
C       location of the A array.   This is  an  extremely  easy data
C       structure to generate.  On  the  other hand it   is  not too
C       efficient on vector computers for  the iterative solution of
C       linear systems.  Hence,   SLAP changes   this  input    data
C       structure to the SLAP Column format  for  the iteration (but
C       does not change it back).
C
C       Here is an example of the  SLAP Triad   storage format for a
C       5x5 Matrix.  Recall that the entries may appear in any order.
C
C           5x5 Matrix      SLAP Triad format for 5x5 matrix on left.
C                              1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11
C       |11 12  0  0 15|   A: 51 12 11 33 15 53 55 22 35 44 21
C       |21 22  0  0  0|  IA:  5  1  1  3  1  5  5  2  3  4  2
C       | 0  0 33  0 35|  JA:  1  2  1  3  5  3  5  2  5  4  1
C       | 0  0  0 44  0|
C       |51  0 53  0 55|
C
C *Portability:
C         You must make sure that IUNIT is a valid Fortran logical
C         I/O device unit number and that the unit number has been
C         associated with a file or the console.  This is a system
C         dependent function.
C
C *Implementation note:
C         SOLN is not read by this version.  It will simply be
C         zeroed out if JOB = 2 or 3 and the returned value of
C         JOB will indicate SOLN has not been read.
