C***DESCRIPTION
C
C **********************************************************************
C     NFC = Number of base solution vectors
C
C     NCOMP = Number of components per solution vector
C
C              1 -- Nonzero particular solution
C     INHOMO =
C              2 or 3 -- Zero particular solution
C
C             0 -- Inhomogeneous vector term G(X) identically zero
C     IGOFX =
C             1 -- Inhomogeneous vector term G(X) not identically zero
C
C     G = Inhomogeneous vector term G(X)
C
C     XSAV = Previous value of X
C
C     C = Normalization factor for the particular solution
C
C           0   ( if  NEQIVP = 0 )
C     IVP =
C           Number of differential equations integrated due to
C           the original boundary value problem   ( if  NEQIVP .GT. 0 )
C
C     NOFST - For problems with auxiliary initial value equations,
C             NOFST communicates to the routine DFMAT how to access
C             the dependent variables corresponding to this initial
C             value problem.  For example, during any call to DFMAT,
C             the first dependent variable for the initial value
C             problem is in position  Y(NOFST + 1).
C             See example in SAND77-1328.
