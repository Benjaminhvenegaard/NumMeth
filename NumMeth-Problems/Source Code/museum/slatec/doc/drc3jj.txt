C *Description:
C
C     Although conventionally the parameters of the vector addition
C  coefficients satisfy certain restrictions, such as being integers
C  or integers plus 1/2, the restrictions imposed on input to this
C  subroutine are somewhat weaker. See, for example, Section 27.9 of
C  Abramowitz and Stegun or Appendix C of Volume II of A. Messiah.
C  The restrictions imposed by this subroutine are
C       1. L2 .GE. ABS(M2) and L3 .GE. ABS(M3);
C       2. L2+ABS(M2) and L3+ABS(M3) must be integers;
C       3. L1MAX-L1MIN must be a non-negative integer, where
C          L1MAX=L2+L3 and L1MIN=MAX(ABS(L2-L3),ABS(M2+M3)).
C  If the conventional restrictions are satisfied, then these
C  restrictions are met.
C
C     The user should be cautious in using input parameters that do
C  not satisfy the conventional restrictions. For example, the
C  the subroutine produces values of
C       f(L1) = ( L1  2.5  5.8)
C               (-0.3 1.5 -1.2)
C  for L1=3.3,4.3,...,8.3 but none of the symmetry properties of the 3j
C  symbol, set forth on page 1056 of Messiah, is satisfied.
C
C     The subroutine generates f(L1MIN), f(L1MIN+1), ..., f(L1MAX)
C  where L1MIN and L1MAX are defined above. The sequence f(L1) is
C  generated by a three-term recurrence algorithm with scaling to
C  control overflow. Both backward and forward recurrence are used to
C  maintain numerical stability. The two recurrence sequences are
C  matched at an interior point and are normalized from the unitary
C  property of 3j coefficients and Wigner's phase convention.
C
C    The algorithm is suited to applications in which large quantum
C  numbers arise, such as in molecular dynamics.

C***REVISION HISTORY  (YYMMDD)
C   750101  DATE WRITTEN
C   880515  SLATEC prologue added by G. C. Nielson, NBS; parameters
C           HUGE and TINY revised to depend on D1MACH.
C   891229  Prologue description rewritten; other prologue sections
C           revised; LMATCH (location of match point for recurrences)
C           removed from argument list; argument IER changed to serve
C           only as an error flag (previously, in cases without error,
C           it returned the number of scalings); number of error codes
C           increased to provide more precise error information;
C           program comments revised; SLATEC error handler calls
C           introduced to enable printing of error messages to meet
C           SLATEC standards. These changes were done by D. W. Lozier,
C           M. A. McClain and J. M. Smith of the National Institute
C           of Standards and Technology, formerly NBS.
C   910415  Mixed type expressions eliminated; variable C1 initialized;
C           description of THRCOF expanded. These changes were done by
C           D. W. Lozier.
