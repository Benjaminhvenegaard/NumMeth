C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   Reduction of the matrix A to lower triangular form by a sequence of
C   orthogonal HOUSEHOLDER transformations post-multiplying A.

C   INPUT
C *********************************************************************
C
C     A -- Contains the matrix to be decomposed, must be dimensioned
C           NRDA by N.
C     N -- Number of rows in the matrix, N greater or equal to 1.
C     M -- Number of columns in the matrix, M greater or equal to N.
C     IFLAG -- Indicates the uncertainty in the matrix data.
C             = 0 when the data is to be treated as exact.
C             =-K when the data is assumed to be accurate to about
C                 K digits.
C     ISCALE -- Scaling indicator.
C               =-1 if the matrix is to be pre-scaled by
C               columns when appropriate.
C               Otherwise no scaling will be attempted.
C     NRDA -- Row dimension of A, NRDA greater or equal to N.
C     DIAG,KPIVOT,ROWS, -- Arrays of length at least N used internally
C          RS,SCALES         (except for SCALES which is M).

C   OUTPUT
C *********************************************************************
C
C     IFLAG - Status indicator
C            =1 for successful decomposition.
C            =2 if improper input is detected.
C            =3 if rank of the matrix is less than N.
C     A -- Contains the reduced matrix in the strictly lower triangular
C          part and transformation information.
C     IRANK -- Contains the numerically determined matrix rank.
C     DIAG -- Contains the diagonal elements of the reduced
C             triangular matrix.
C     KPIVOT -- Contains the pivotal information, the column
C               interchanges performed on the original matrix are
C               recorded here.
C     SCALES -- Contains the column scaling parameters.
