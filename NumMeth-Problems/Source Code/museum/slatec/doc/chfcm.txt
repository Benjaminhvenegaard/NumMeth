C***TYPE      SINGLE PRECISION (CHFCM-S, DCHFCM-D)
C***AUTHOR  Fritsch, F. N., (LLNL)
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C *Usage:
C
C        REAL  D1, D2, DELTA
C        INTEGER  ISMON, CHFCM
C
C        ISMON = CHFCM (D1, D2, DELTA)
C
C *Arguments:
C
C     D1,D2:IN  are the derivative values at the ends of an interval.
C
C     DELTA:IN  is the data slope over that interval.
C
C *Function Return Values:
C     ISMON : indicates the monotonicity of the cubic segment:
C             ISMON = -3  if function is probably decreasing;
C             ISMON = -1  if function is strictly decreasing;
C             ISMON =  0  if function is constant;
C             ISMON =  1  if function is strictly increasing;
C             ISMON =  2  if function is non-monotonic;
C             ISMON =  3  if function is probably increasing.
C           If ABS(ISMON)=3, the derivative values are too close to the
C           boundary of the monotonicity region to declare monotonicity
C           in the presence of roundoff error.

C *Description:
C
C          CHFCM:  Cubic Hermite Function -- Check Monotonicity.
C
C    Called by  PCHCM  to determine the monotonicity properties of the
C    cubic with boundary derivative values D1,D2 and chord slope DELTA.
C
C *Cautions:
C     This is essentially the same as old CHFMC, except that a
C     new output value, -3, was added February 1989.  (Formerly, -3
C     and +3 were lumped together in the single value 3.)  Codes that
C     flag nonmonotonicity by "IF (ISMON.EQ.2)" need not be changed.
C     Codes that check via "IF (ISMON.GE.3)" should change the test to
C     "IF (IABS(ISMON).GE.3)".  Codes that declare monotonicity via
C     "IF (ISMON.LE.1)" should change to "IF (IABS(ISMON).LE.1)".

C***ROUTINES CALLED  R1MACH
C***REVISION HISTORY  (YYMMDD)
C   820518  DATE WRITTEN
C   820805  Converted to SLATEC library version.
C   831201  Changed from  ISIGN  to SIGN  to correct bug that
C           produced wrong sign when -1 .LT. DELTA .LT. 0 .
C   890206  Added SAVE statements.
C   890207  Added sign to returned value ISMON=3 and corrected
C           argument description accordingly.
C   890306  Added caution about changed output.
C   890407  Changed name from CHFMC to CHFCM, as requested at the
C           March 1989 SLATEC CML meeting, and made a few other
C           minor modifications necessitated by this change.
C   890407  Converted to new SLATEC format.
C   890407  Modified DESCRIPTION to LDOC format.
C   891214  Moved SAVE statements.  (WRB)
