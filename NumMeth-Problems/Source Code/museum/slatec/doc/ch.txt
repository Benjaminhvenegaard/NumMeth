C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine calls the recommended sequence of
C     subroutines from the eigensystem subroutine package (EISPACK)
C     to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (if desired)
C     of a COMPLEX HERMITIAN matrix.
C
C     On INPUT
C
C        NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional
C          array parameters, AR, AI, ZR and ZI, as declared in the
C          calling program dimension statement.  NM is an INTEGER
C          variable.
C
C        N is the order of the matrix A=(AR,AI).  N is an INTEGER
C          variable.  N must be less than or equal to NM.
C
C        AR and AI contain the real and imaginary parts, respectively,
C          of the complex Hermitian matrix.  AR and AI are
C          two-dimensional REAL arrays, dimensioned AR(NM,N)
C          and AI(NM,N).
C
C        MATZ is an INTEGER variable set equal to zero if only
C          eigenvalues are desired.  Otherwise, it is set to any
C          non-zero integer for both eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
C
C     On OUTPUT
C
C        W contains the eigenvalues in ascending order.
C          W is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned W(N).
C
C        ZR and ZI contain the real and imaginary parts, respectively,
C          of the eigenvectors if MATZ is not zero.  ZR and ZI are
C          two-dimensional REAL arrays, dimensioned ZR(NM,N) and
C          ZI(NM,N).
C
C        IERR is an INTEGER flag set to
C          Zero       for normal return,
C          10*N       if N is greater than NM,
C          J          if the J-th eigenvalue has not been
C                     determined after a total of 30 iterations.
C                     The eigenvalues should be correct for indices
C                     1, 2, ..., IERR-1, but no eigenvectors are
C                     computed.
C
C        FV1 and FV2 are one-dimensional REAL arrays used for
C          temporary storage, dimensioned FV1(N) and FV2(N).
C
C        FM1 is a two-dimensional REAL array used for temporary
C          storage, dimensioned FM1(2,N).
