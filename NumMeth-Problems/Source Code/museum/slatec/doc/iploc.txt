C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   Given a "virtual" location,  IPLOC returns the relative working
C   address of the vector component stored in SX, IX.  Any necessary
C   page swaps are performed automatically for the user in this
C   function subprogram.

C   LOC       is the "virtual" address of the data to be retrieved.
C   SX ,IX    represent the matrix where the data is stored.
