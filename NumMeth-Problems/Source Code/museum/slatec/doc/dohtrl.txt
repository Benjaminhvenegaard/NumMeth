C***PURPOSE  Subsidiary to DBVSUP and DSUDS
C***LIBRARY   SLATEC
C***TYPE      DOUBLE PRECISION (OHTROL-S, DOHTRL-D)
C***AUTHOR  Watts, H. A., (SNLA)
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     For a rank deficient problem, additional orthogonal
C     HOUSEHOLDER transformations are applied to the left side
C     of Q to further reduce the triangular form.
C     Thus, after application of the routines DORTHR and DOHTRL
C     to the original matrix, the result is a nonsingular
C     triangular matrix while the remainder of the matrix
C     has been zeroed out.
