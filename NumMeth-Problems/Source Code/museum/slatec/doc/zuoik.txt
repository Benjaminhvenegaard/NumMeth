C***AUTHOR  Amos, D. E., (SNL)
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     ZUOIK COMPUTES THE LEADING TERMS OF THE UNIFORM ASYMPTOTIC
C     EXPANSIONS FOR THE I AND K FUNCTIONS AND COMPARES THEM
C     (IN LOGARITHMIC FORM) TO ALIM AND ELIM FOR OVER AND UNDERFLOW
C     WHERE ALIM.LT.ELIM. IF THE MAGNITUDE, BASED ON THE LEADING
C     EXPONENTIAL, IS LESS THAN ALIM OR GREATER THAN -ALIM, THEN
C     THE RESULT IS ON SCALE. IF NOT, THEN A REFINED TEST USING OTHER
C     MULTIPLIERS (IN LOGARITHMIC FORM) IS MADE BASED ON ELIM. HERE
C     EXP(-ELIM)=SMALLEST MACHINE NUMBER*1.0E+3 AND EXP(-ALIM)=
C     EXP(-ELIM)/TOL
C
C     IKFLG=1 MEANS THE I SEQUENCE IS TESTED
C          =2 MEANS THE K SEQUENCE IS TESTED
C     NUF = 0 MEANS THE LAST MEMBER OF THE SEQUENCE IS ON SCALE
C         =-1 MEANS AN OVERFLOW WOULD OCCUR
C     IKFLG=1 AND NUF.GT.0 MEANS THE LAST NUF Y VALUES WERE SET TO ZERO
C             THE FIRST N-NUF VALUES MUST BE SET BY ANOTHER ROUTINE
C     IKFLG=2 AND NUF.EQ.N MEANS ALL Y VALUES WERE SET TO ZERO
C     IKFLG=2 AND 0.LT.NUF.LT.N NOT CONSIDERED. Y MUST BE SET BY
C             ANOTHER ROUTINE
