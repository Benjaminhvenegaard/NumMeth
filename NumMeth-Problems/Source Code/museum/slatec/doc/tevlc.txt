C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine finds the eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal
C     matrix by the rational QL method.
C
C     On Input-
C
C        N is the order of the matrix,
C
C        D contains the diagonal elements of the input matrix,
C
C        E2 contains the subdiagonal elements of the input matrix
C           in its last N-1 positions.  E2(1) is arbitrary.
C
C      On Output-
C
C        D contains the eigenvalues in ascending order.  If an
C          error exit is made, the eigenvalues are correct and
C          ordered for indices 1,2,...IERR-1, but may not be
C          the smallest eigenvalues,
C
C        E2 has been destroyed,
C
C        IERR is set to
C          ZERO       for normal return,
C          J          if the J-th eigenvalue has not been
C                     determined after 30 iterations.
