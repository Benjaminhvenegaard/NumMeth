C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  DSYMM  performs one of the matrix-matrix operations
C
C     C := alpha*A*B + beta*C,
C
C  or
C
C     C := alpha*B*A + beta*C,
C
C  where alpha and beta are scalars,  A is a symmetric matrix and  B and
C  C are  m by n matrices.
C
C  Parameters
C  ==========
C
C  SIDE   - CHARACTER*1.
C           On entry,  SIDE  specifies whether  the  symmetric matrix  A
C           appears on the  left or right  in the  operation as follows:
C
C              SIDE = 'L' or 'l'   C := alpha*A*B + beta*C,
C
C              SIDE = 'R' or 'r'   C := alpha*B*A + beta*C,
C
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  UPLO   - CHARACTER*1.
C           On  entry,   UPLO  specifies  whether  the  upper  or  lower
C           triangular  part  of  the  symmetric  matrix   A  is  to  be
C           referenced as follows:
C
C              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   Only the upper triangular part of the
C                                  symmetric matrix is to be referenced.
C
C              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   Only the lower triangular part of the
C                                  symmetric matrix is to be referenced.
C
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  M      - INTEGER.
C           On entry,  M  specifies the number of rows of the matrix  C.
C           M  must be at least zero.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  N      - INTEGER.
C           On entry, N specifies the number of columns of the matrix C.
C           N  must be at least zero.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  ALPHA  - DOUBLE PRECISION.
C           On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  A      - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION ( LDA, ka ), where ka is
C           m  when  SIDE = 'L' or 'l'  and is  n otherwise.
C           Before entry  with  SIDE = 'L' or 'l',  the  m by m  part of
C           the array  A  must contain the  symmetric matrix,  such that
C           when  UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the leading m by m upper triangular
C           part of the array  A  must contain the upper triangular part
C           of the  symmetric matrix and the  strictly  lower triangular
C           part of  A  is not referenced,  and when  UPLO = 'L' or 'l',
C           the leading  m by m  lower triangular part  of the  array  A
C           must  contain  the  lower triangular part  of the  symmetric
C           matrix and the  strictly upper triangular part of  A  is not
C           referenced.
C           Before entry  with  SIDE = 'R' or 'r',  the  n by n  part of
C           the array  A  must contain the  symmetric matrix,  such that
C           when  UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the leading n by n upper triangular
C           part of the array  A  must contain the upper triangular part
C           of the  symmetric matrix and the  strictly  lower triangular
C           part of  A  is not referenced,  and when  UPLO = 'L' or 'l',
C           the leading  n by n  lower triangular part  of the  array  A
C           must  contain  the  lower triangular part  of the  symmetric
C           matrix and the  strictly upper triangular part of  A  is not
C           referenced.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  LDA    - INTEGER.
C           On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
C           in the calling (sub) program.  When  SIDE = 'L' or 'l'  then
C           LDA must be at least  max( 1, m ), otherwise  LDA must be at
C           least  max( 1, n ).
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  B      - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION ( LDB, n ).
C           Before entry, the leading  m by n part of the array  B  must
C           contain the matrix B.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  LDB    - INTEGER.
C           On entry, LDB specifies the first dimension of B as declared
C           in  the  calling  (sub)  program.   LDB  must  be  at  least
C           max( 1, m ).
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  BETA   - DOUBLE PRECISION.
C           On entry,  BETA  specifies the scalar  beta.  When  BETA  is
C           supplied as zero then C need not be set on input.
C           Unchanged on exit.
C
C  C      - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION ( LDC, n ).
C           Before entry, the leading  m by n  part of the array  C must
C           contain the matrix  C,  except when  beta  is zero, in which
C           case C need not be set on entry.
C           On exit, the array  C  is overwritten by the  m by n updated
C           matrix.
C
C  LDC    - INTEGER.
C           On entry, LDC specifies the first dimension of C as declared
C           in  the  calling  (sub)  program.   LDC  must  be  at  least
C           max( 1, m ).
