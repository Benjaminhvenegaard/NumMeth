C***DESCRIPTION
C
C Evaluate for large Z  Z**A * U(A,B,Z)  where U is the logarithmic
C confluent hypergeometric function.  A rational approximation due to Y.
C L. Luke is used.  When U is not in the asymptotic region, i.e., when A
C or B is large compared with Z, considerable significance loss occurs.
C A warning is provided when the computed result is less than half
C precision.
