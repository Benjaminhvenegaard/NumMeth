C     Abstract -
C        Subroutine POLYVL calculates the value of the polynomial and
C     its first NDER derivatives where the polynomial was produced by
C     a previous call to POLINT.
C        The variable N and the arrays X and C must not be altered
C     between the call to POLINT and the call to POLYVL.
C
C     ******  Dimensioning Information *******
C
C     YP   must be dimensioned by at least NDER
C     X    must be dimensioned by at least N (see the abstract )
C     C    must be dimensioned by at least N (see the abstract )
C     WORK must be dimensioned by at least 2*N if NDER is .GT. 0.
C
C     *** Note ***
C       If NDER=0, neither YP nor WORK need to be dimensioned variables.
C       If NDER=1, YP does not need to be a dimensioned variable.
C
C
C     *****  Input parameters
C
C     NDER - the number of derivatives to be evaluated
C
C     XX   - the argument at which the polynomial and its derivatives
C            are to be evaluated.
C
C     N    - *****
C            *       N, X, and C must not be altered between the call
C     X    - *       to POLINT and the call to POLYVL.

C
C
C     *****  Output Parameters
C
C     YFIT - the value of the polynomial at XX
C
C     YP   - the derivatives of the polynomial at XX.  The derivative of
C            order J at XX is stored in  YP(J) , J = 1,...,NDER.
C
C     IERR - Output error flag with the following possible values.
C          = 1  indicates normal execution
C
C     ***** Storage Parameters
C
C     WORK  = this is an array to provide internal working storage for
C             POLYVL.  It must be dimensioned by at least 2*N if NDER is
C             .GT. 0.  If NDER=0, WORK does not need to be a dimensioned
C             variable.
