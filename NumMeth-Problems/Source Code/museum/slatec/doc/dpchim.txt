C***PURPOSE  Set derivatives needed to determine a monotone piecewise
C            cubic Hermite interpolant to given data.  Boundary values
C            are provided which are compatible with monotonicity.  The
C            interpolant will have an extremum at each point where mono-
C            tonicity switches direction.  (See DPCHIC if user control
C            is desired over boundary or switch conditions.)

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C          DPCHIM:  Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolation to
C                  Monotone data.
C
C     Sets derivatives needed to determine a monotone piecewise cubic
C     Hermite interpolant to the data given in X and F.
C
C     Default boundary conditions are provided which are compatible
C     with monotonicity.  (See DPCHIC if user control of boundary con-
C     ditions is desired.)
C
C     If the data are only piecewise monotonic, the interpolant will
C     have an extremum at each point where monotonicity switches direc-
C     tion.  (See DPCHIC if user control is desired in such cases.)
C
C     To facilitate two-dimensional applications, includes an increment
C     between successive values of the F- and D-arrays.
C
C     The resulting piecewise cubic Hermite function may be evaluated
C     by DPCHFE or DPCHFD.

C
C  Calling sequence:
C
C        PARAMETER  (INCFD = ...)
C        INTEGER  N, IERR
C        DOUBLE PRECISION  X(N), F(INCFD,N), D(INCFD,N)
C
C        CALL  DPCHIM (N, X, F, D, INCFD, IERR)
C
C   Parameters:
C
C     N -- (input) number of data points.  (Error return if N.LT.2 .)
C           If N=2, simply does linear interpolation.
C
C     X -- (input) real*8 array of independent variable values.  The
C           elements of X must be strictly increasing:
C                X(I-1) .LT. X(I),  I = 2(1)N.
C           (Error return if not.)
C
C     F -- (input) real*8 array of dependent variable values to be
C           interpolated.  F(1+(I-1)*INCFD) is value corresponding to
C           X(I).  DPCHIM is designed for monotonic data, but it will
C           work for any F-array.  It will force extrema at points where
C           monotonicity switches direction.  If some other treatment of
C           switch points is desired, DPCHIC should be used instead.
C                                     -----
C     D -- (output) real*8 array of derivative values at the data
C           points.  If the data are monotonic, these values will
C           determine a monotone cubic Hermite function.
C           The value corresponding to X(I) is stored in
C                D(1+(I-1)*INCFD),  I=1(1)N.
C           No other entries in D are changed.
C
C     INCFD -- (input) increment between successive values in F and D.
C           This argument is provided primarily for 2-D applications.
C           (Error return if  INCFD.LT.1 .)
C
C     IERR -- (output) error flag.
C           Normal return:
C              IERR = 0  (no errors).
C           Warning error:
C              IERR.GT.0  means that IERR switches in the direction
C                 of monotonicity were detected.
C           "Recoverable" errors:
C              IERR = -1  if N.LT.2 .
C              IERR = -2  if INCFD.LT.1 .
C              IERR = -3  if the X-array is not strictly increasing.
C             (The D-array has not been changed in any of these cases.)
C               NOTE:  The above errors are checked in the order listed,
C                   and following arguments have **NOT** been validated.
