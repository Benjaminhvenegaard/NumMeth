C***DESCRIPTION
C
C         DEXINT computes M member sequences of exponential integrals
C         E(N+K,X), K=0,1,...,M-1 for N .GE. 1 and X .GE. 0.  The
C         exponential integral is defined by
C
C         E(N,X)=integral on (1,infinity) of EXP(-XT)/T**N
C
C         where X=0.0 and N=1 cannot occur simultaneously.  Formulas
C         and notation are found in the NBS Handbook of Mathematical
C         Functions (ref. 1).
C
C         The power series is implemented for X .LE. XCUT and the
C         confluent hypergeometric representation
C
C                     E(A,X) = EXP(-X)*(X**(A-1))*U(A,A,X)
C
C         is computed for X .GT. XCUT.  Since sequences are computed in
C         a stable fashion by recurring away from X, A is selected as
C         the integer closest to X within the constraint N .LE. A .LE.
C         N+M-1.  For the U computation, A is further modified to be the
C         nearest even integer.  Indices are carried forward or
C         backward by the two term recursion relation
C
C                     K*E(K+1,X) + X*E(K,X) = EXP(-X)
C
C         once E(A,X) is computed.  The U function is computed by means
C         of the backward recursive Miller algorithm applied to the
C         three term contiguous relation for U(A+K,A,X), K=0,1,...
C         This produces accurate ratios and determines U(A+K,A,X), and
C         hence E(A,X), to within a multiplicative constant C.
C         Another contiguous relation applied to C*U(A,A,X) and
C         C*U(A+1,A,X) gets C*U(A+1,A+1,X), a quantity proportional to
C         E(A+1,X).  The normalizing constant C is obtained from the
C         two term recursion relation above with K=A.
C
C         The maximum number of significant digits obtainable
C         is the smaller of 14 and the number of digits carried in
C         double precision arithmetic.
