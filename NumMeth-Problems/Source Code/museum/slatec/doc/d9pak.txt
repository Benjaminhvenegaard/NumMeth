C***DESCRIPTION
C
C Pack a base 2 exponent into floating point number X.  This routine is
C almost the inverse of D9UPAK.  It is not exactly the inverse, because
C ABS(X) need not be between 0.5 and 1.0.  If both D9PAK and 2.d0**N
C were known to be in range we could compute
C               D9PAK = X *2.0d0**N
