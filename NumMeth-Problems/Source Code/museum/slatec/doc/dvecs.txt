C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  This subroutine is used for the special structure of COMPLEX*16
C  valued problems. DMGSBV is called upon to obtain LNFC vectors from an
C  original set of 2*LNFC independent vectors so that the resulting
C  LNFC vectors together with their imaginary product or mate vectors
C  form an independent set.
