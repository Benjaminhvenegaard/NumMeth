C***DESCRIPTION
C
C        Evaluate a complex polynomial and its derivatives.
C        Optionally compute error bounds for these values.
C
C   INPUT...
C        N = Degree of the polynomial
C        M = Number of derivatives to be calculated,
C            M=0 evaluates only the function
C            M=1 evaluates the function and first derivative, etc.
C             if M .GT. N+1 function and all N derivatives will be
C                calculated.
C       A = Complex vector containing the N+1 coefficients of polynomial
C               A(I)= coefficient of Z**(N+1-I)
C        Z = Complex point at which the evaluation is to take place.
C        C = Array of 2(M+1) words into which values are placed.
C        B = Array of 2(M+1) words only needed if bounds are to be
C              calculated.  It is not used otherwise.
C        KBD = A logical variable, e.g. .TRUE. or .FALSE. which is
C              to be set .TRUE. if bounds are to be computed.
C
C  OUTPUT...
C        C =  C(I+1) contains the complex value of the I-th
C              derivative at Z, I=0,...,M
C        B =  B(I) contains the bounds on the real and imaginary parts
C              of C(I) if they were requested.
