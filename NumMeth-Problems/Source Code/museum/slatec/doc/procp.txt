C***DESCRIPTION
C
C PROCP applies a sequence of matrix operations to the vector X and
C stores the result in Y (periodic boundary conditions).
C
C BD,BM1,BM2 are arrays containing roots of certain B polynomials.
C ND,NM1,NM2 are the lengths of the arrays BD,BM1,BM2 respectively.
C AA         Array containing scalar multipliers of the vector X.
C NA         is the length of the array AA.
C X,Y        The matrix operations are applied to X and the result is Y.
C A,B,C      are arrays which contain the tridiagonal matrix.
C M          is the order of the matrix.
C D,U,W      are working arrays.
C IS         determines whether or not a change in sign is made.
