SHORT FORM OF SLATEC COMMON MATHEMATICAL LIBRARY (CML) INSTRUCTIONS:

1.  SLATEC is public domain -- no conditions on use or redistribution.
2.  Peruse the file "CMLUTILS.F" from this directory; most routines
    require at least several of the routines in that file.
3.  Edit the file "CMLUTILS.F" to make its parameters correspond to
    your machine type.  (As provided, it is, very roughly, IEEE generic.)
4.  Locate the routine(s) you want in the GAMS.HTM subject classification
    tree and TOC.HTM table of contents.  Jump (in your Web browser) or
    change directories to the corresponding directory under DIRS.
5.  Copy to your working directory the .F file (FORTRAN source), the .TXT
    file (documentation), and (if there is a dependencies directory) all
    the .F files there.  Compile these along with CMLUTILS.F .
