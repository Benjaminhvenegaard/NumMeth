<h1>Macintosh Troubles?</h1>

On many Macintosh machines, large directories
take so long to display that you will think that your machine has frozen.
Therefore, in a directory display, avoid choosing "Up to Higher Level";
instead use your browser's "Back" button or command.<p>

Also, in some versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer for Mac, you will not be
able to display directories at all!  Instead, use the Finder to navigate
through the directory tree.  (This latter bug is not present in
Netscape Navigator.)<p>

We are as unhappy about these bugs (or features) as you are.  The first
is an innate problem with the Macintosh operating system (at least in
many versions), while the second appears to be a bug in Microsoft Internet
Explorer for Macintosh (not present in Windows versions of the product).<p>
