given in Spanier and Oldham, a number of functions are modeled

Package for C++ for classes of vectors & matrices of complex
numbers with typical operations (multiplication, etc.).  NOT as
complete as that in, say, B. Eckel's book but better handling of
storage allocation (see forthcoming article in C User's Journal
for a discussion).

Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic & Number Theory ($9.95)<p>

Contents: 1) a package of arbitrary precision routines for
add,subtract, multiply, divide for integers, rationals, and
reals.  Conversion from rational to real, between type long and
integers, and between real and type double (uses sscanf, only
precision of type float achieved). Arbitrary precision integer
arithmetic for: greatest common divisor (gcd) of m,n (also finds
m',n' such that m'm+n'n=gcd), a^b mod c (or a^b when c=0) and
a*b mod c, generating and testing large primes, generating RSA
cryptosystem keys, encrypting & decrypting in RSA system, and
converting between number systems of different bases.  2) a
package to do basic number theory, using the above, including:
Jacobi and Moebius symbols, Jordan J, Mangoldt Lambda, Liouville
nu (count of prime divisors), prime factors, divisors, sigma
(sum of kth powers of divisors, k&gt;=0), and calculate the
partition numbers p(n) and q(n) either by recurrence or
asymptotically.  For binary bases, shifts and modular
square roots may be found.
There are caveats (specfied below) on using the
second package for factoring large numbers (greater than two
hundred million) or determining the number of partitions for
large numbers.  The factoring is done "brute force." A more
efficient method may be implemented in the future.  A table of
primes up to 16,384 is provided, which makes factoring
realtively efficient up to numbers below 268 million, beyond
which primes have to be generated and then used as candidate
factors.  Due to imprecisions in floating-point arithmetic, the
asymptotic results for p and q may not be exact, although the
formulae are in principle capable of exactly determining the
(integer) p and q.<p>

Also included are C++ routines for classes Integer, Rational, Real to
permit writing code such as:  Integer A,B,C,D; A=B*C+D; where
A, etc. are arb. prec. integers.  Various conversions are provided;
a large integer may be written as a string, e.g.: "1234567890".
The Rational and Real classes closely follow that of Integer, but have
not been fully tested.<p>

<hr>

Sparse Matrix Package. ($19.95)<p>

Includes linear system solvers using Generalized Minimum
Residual Method (GMRES), minmum residual method (MRES)
and the stabilized bi-conjugate gradient method (BiCSTAB)
 for general systems,  and conjugate gradient method for symmetric
positive-defininte systems. Chokesky (LDL*) decompostion for
symmetric positive-definite matrices.  LU decomposition for
various matrices with fill control. Various preconditioning
methods. In C. Also a good bibliography on these methods.
Very useful for those starting research in this area.  Note that
preconditioning is still an art, not a science, so the user will
have to experiment to find the best methods and preconditioners
for his problem.  This is a rapidly evolving field!<p>
