<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>This book presents a new, efficient numerical-analytical method for solving t
he Laplace equation on an arbitrary polygon called the approximate block method.
 The block method overcomes indicated difficulties naturally and has qualitative
ly more rapid convergence than well-known difference and variational-difference 
methods. The block method also solves the complicated problem of approximate con
formal mapping of multiply-connected polygons onto canonical domains with no pre
liminary information required. The high-precision results of calculations carrie
d out on the computer are presented in an abundance of tables substantiating the
 exponential convergence of the block method and its strong stability concerning
 the rounding-off of errors.

<h3>AUDIENCE</h3>
<p>Researchers, practitioners, post-graduates, and all who routinely work with a
pproximate methods of solving differential equations.
