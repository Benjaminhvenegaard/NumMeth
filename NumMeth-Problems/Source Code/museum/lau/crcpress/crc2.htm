<P>

The mathematics employed by genetic algorithms (GAs) are among

the most exciting discoveries of the last few decades. But what

exactly <I>is</I> a genetic algorithm? A genetic algorithm is

a problem-solving method that uses genetics as its model of problem

solving. It applies the rules of reproduction, gene crossover,

and mutation to pseudo-organisms so those &quot;organisms&quot;

can pass beneficial and survival-enhancing traits to new generations.

GAs are useful in the selection of parameters to optimize a system's

performance. A second potential use lies in testing and fitting

quantitative models. Unlike any other book available, this interesting

new text/reference takes you from the construction of a simple

GA to advanced implementations. As you come to understand GAs

and their processes, you will begin to understand the power of

the genetic-based problem-solving paradigms that lie behind them.

<P>

The <B>Practical Handbook of Genetic Algorithms</B> presents for

the first time new areas of research and implementation. Problems

that for many have been considered intractable are shown to be

solvable using the techniques described in this work. Specific

solution descriptions to real-world problems are provided, or

use these as examples to develop solutions to unique problems.

<P>

The book does more than just describe GAs. Almost two hundred

figures and numerous tables <I>show</I> how they should look and

how they work. This first volume of the <B>Practical Handbook

of Genetic Algorithms (GAs)</B> and the included software present

the most comprehensive selection of hybrid methods for designing

efficient and effective solutions for even the most highly complex

problems.

<P>

<B>Volume II</B> picks up where the first book leaves off and

presents the topic from more of an applications point of view.

The focus of the book is to show the reader how to develop their

own genetic algorithm coding schemes and how and when to employ

the GA to solve problems.
