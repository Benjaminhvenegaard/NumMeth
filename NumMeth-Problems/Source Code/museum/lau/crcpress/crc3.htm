Symmetries, Exact Solutions, and Conservation Laws</H3>



<H3>Description</H3>



<P>

The first part of Volume 1 systematizes the relevant results of

Lie and natural generalizations, guides the reader through all

group theoretical methods (with a minimum number of theoretical

constructions), and introduces the skills necessary to apply the

results and methods in Part B to new problems. Part B is devoted

to the group classification and characterization of differential

equations. It also tabulates their Lie point and contact symmetries,

Lie-Bdcklund and nonlocal symmetries, Bdcklund transformations,

exact solutions, and conservation laws. Part C addresses numerical

considerations.

<H3><A NAME="volthree">Volume 3</A><BR>

New Trends in Theoretical Developments and Computational Methods

</H3>



<H3>Description</H3>



<P>

Today Lie group theoretical approach to differential equations

has been extended to new situations and has become applicable

to the majority of equations that frequently occur in applied

sciences. Newly developed theoretical and computational methods

are awaiting application. Students and applied scientists are

expected to understand these methods. Volume 3 and the accompanying

software allow readers to extend their knowledge of computational

algebra.

<P>

Written by the leading world experts in the field, this up-to-date

source book covers topics such as Lie-Bdcklund, conditional

and non-classical symmetries, approximate symmetry groups for

equations with a small parameter, group analysis of differential

equations with distributions, integro-differential equations,

recursions, and symbolic software packages. The text provides

an ideal introduction to the modern group analysis and addresses

issues to both beginners and experienced researchers in the application

of Lie group methods.

Applications in Engineering and Physical Sciences</H2>



<H3>Description</H3>



<P>

Volume 2 is divided into three parts. Part A focuses on relevant

definitions, main algorithms, group classification schemes for

partial differential equations, and multifaceted possibilities

offered by Lie group theoretic philosophy. Part B tabulates symmetry

groups and solutions for linear equations of mathematical physics,

classical field theory, viscous and non-Newtonian fluids, boundary

layer problems, Earth sciences, elasticity, plasticity, plasma

theory, and nonlinear optics and acoustics. The last part offers

an English translation of Sophus Lie's fundamental paper on the

group classification and invariant solutions of linear second-order

equations with two independent variables.
