<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>For most scientists and engineers, the only analytic technique for solving li
near partial differential equations is separation of variables. In <b>Transform 
Methods for Solving Partial Differential Equations</b>, the author uses the powe
r of complex variables to demonstrate how Laplace and Fourier transforms can be 
harnessed to solve many practical, everyday problems experienced by scientists a
nd engineers. Unlike many mathematics texts, this book provides a step-by-step a
nalysis of problems taken from scientific and engineering literature. Detailed s
olutions are given in the back of the book. This essential text/reference draws 
from the latest literature on transform methods to provide in-depth discussions 
on the joint transform problem, the Cagniard-de Hoop method, and the Wiener-Hopf
 technique. Some 1,500 references are included as well. 

<h3>AUDIENCE</h3>
<p>Physicists, geophysicists, applied mathematicians, electrical engineers, mech
anical engineers, and other scientists and engineers who use transform methods.
