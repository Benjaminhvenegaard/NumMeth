<p>This book presents new original numerical methods that have been developed to
 the stage of concrete algorithms and successfully applied to practical problems
 in mathematical physics. The book discusses new methods for solving stiff syste
ms of ordinary differential equations, stiff elliptic problems encountered in pr
oblems of composite material mechanics, Navier-Stokes systems, and nonstationary
 problems with discontinuous data. These methods allow natural paralleling of al
gorithms and will find many applications in vector and parallel computers. 

<h3>AUDIENCE</h3>
<p>Specialists in numerical methods, practical computer users solving research a
nd engineering problems, and students in mathematics, engineering, and physics.

<h3>FEATURES</h3>
<ul>
<li>Presents a multitude of various problems and approaches for solving them
<li>Features new contributions from world-renowned mathematicians
<li>Proposes methods oriented to applications in vector and parallel computers
</ul>
