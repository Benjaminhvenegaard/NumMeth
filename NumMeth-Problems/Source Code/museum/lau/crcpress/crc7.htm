<P>
<B>Advanced Mathematics and Mechanics Applications Using MATLAB</b> illustrates 
the problem-solving capabilities of MATLAB in advanced

engineering and the physical sciences. The book covers a wide

range of numerical topics and discusses the algorithmic methods

that can be used for their solution. The applications emphasize

solutions of linear and nonlinear differential equations. Linear

partial differential equations and linear matrix differential

equations are analyzed using eigenfunctions and series solutions.

Several other diverse topics, such as conformal mapping, heat

conduction, and inertial property calculation for areas, are also

included.

<P>
The text has numerous sample programs that can be used to solve

complicated applied problems. The programs have extensive comments

and are intended for separate study without additional reference.

Many of the programs presented in the text treat applications

not presented in traditional texts, e.g., spline computation of

inertia properties of arbitrary areas. Additionally, all the programs

are contained on a diskette accompanying the book. This diskette

is organized with directories corresponding to different chapters,

and a group of frequently used functions-such as those for spline

interpolation and interactive data input-comprises a separate

utility library.
