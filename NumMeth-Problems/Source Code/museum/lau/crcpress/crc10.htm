<h3>Description</h3>
<p>

This concise, straightforward guide provides an all-purpose
introduction to writing and preparing papers, reports, articles, and
books with TeX. Scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and technical
staff will discover how easy it is to clearly and quickly perform all
the necessary tasks required to prepare equations and text. The first
half of the book is devoted to explaining how to typeset equations,
while the remainder of the book addresses advanced topics and more
general text processing and page formatting topics. A <b>TeX Primer
for Scientists</b> will save you time and reduce frustration while
increasing the flexibility, quality, and efficiency of your documents.
