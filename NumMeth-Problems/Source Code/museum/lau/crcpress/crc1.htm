<h1>A Numerical Library in C for Scientists and Engineers</h1>

<hr>

<h3>Author - H.T. Lau
</h3><p><i>Concordia University and Bell Northern Research, Montreal, Quebec</i>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>This extensive library of computer programs-written in  <b>C</b>  language-al
lows readers to solve numerical problems in areas of linear algebra, ordinary an
d partial differential equations, optimization, parameter estimation, and specia
l functions of mathematical physics.

<p>The library is based on NUMAL, the program assemblage developed and used at t
he Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science in Amsterdam, one of the world's 
leading research centers. The important characteristic of the library is its mod
ular structure. Because it is highly compact, it is well-suited for use on perso
nal computers.

<p>The library offers the expert a prodigious collection of procedures for imple
menting numerical methods. The novice can experiment with the worked examples pr
ovided and use the more comprehensive procedures to perform mathematical computa
tions. The library provides a powerful research tool for computer scientists, en
gineers, and applied mathematicians.

<h3>FEATURES</h3>
<ul>
<li>Provides a high quality, inexpensive mathematical library
<li>Offers a highly compact modular structure particularly suited to implementat
ion on a personal computer
<li>Uses the ANSI C standard throughout to ensure portability
<li>Includes 130 pages of worked examples
</ul>
