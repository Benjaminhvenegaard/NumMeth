<P>

<B>Volume 2</B> offers a unique blend of classical results of

Sophus Lie with new, modern developments and numerous applications

which span a period of more than 100 years. As a result, this

reference is up to date, with the latest information on the group

theoretic methods used frequently in mathematical physics and

engineering.

<P>

<B>Volume 2</B> is divided into three parts. Part A focuses on

relevant definitions, main algorithms, group classification schemes

for partial differential equations, and multifaceted possibilities

offered by Lie group theoretic philosophy. Part B contains the

group analysis of a variety of mathematical models for diverse

natural phenomena. It tabulates symmetry groups and solutions

for linear equations of mathematical physics, classical field

theory, viscous and non-Newtonian fluids, boundary layer problems,

Earth sciences, elasticity, plasticity, plasma theory (Vlasov-Maxwell

equations), and  nonlinear optics and acoustics. Part C offers

an English translation of Sophus Lie's fundamental paper on the

group classification and invariant solutions of linear second-order

equations with two independent variables. This will serve as a

concise, practical guide to the group analysis of partial differential

equations.
