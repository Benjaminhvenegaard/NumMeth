<P>

Today Lie group theoretical approach to differential equations

has been extended to new situations and has become applicable

to the majority of equations that frequently occur in applied

sciences. Newly developed theoretical and computational methods

are awaiting application. Students and applied scientists are

expected to understand these methods. <B>Volume 3</B> and the

accompanying software allow readers to extend their knowledge

of computational algebra.

<P>

Written by the world's leading experts in the field, this up-to-date

sourcebook covers topics such as Lie - B&auml;cklund, conditional

and non-classical symmetries, approximate symmetry groups for

equations with a small parameter, group analysis of differential

equations with distributions, integro-differential equations,

recursions, and symbolic software packages. The text provides

an ideal introduction to modern group analysis and addresses issues

to both beginners and experienced researchers in the application

of Lie group methods.
