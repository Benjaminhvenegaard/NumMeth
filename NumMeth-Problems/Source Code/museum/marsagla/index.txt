   Professor Marsaglia's CDROM, based on research supported by the
   National Science Foundation under grants DMS-8807976 and DMS-9206972,
   contains approximately 600 Mbytes of files of random bytes that pass
   all known tests for randomness. Those files are not included on this
   CDROM. Here is the top level readme file from Marsaglia's full CDROM.
   
   The files included on this CDROM relate to Marsaglia's rightly famous,
   if whimsically named, "Diehard battery of tests of randomness". These
   have come be viewed as something of an industry standard for testing
   random number generators. Over the years, several generators thought
   to be good have been shown to be inadequate by these tests.
   
   Here is a directory of source files for the Diehard tests. The
   principal program needed is diehard.c. Note that this is a C program
   automatically translated from the original Fortran by the program
   "f2c" (included elsewhere on this CDROM. To compile Diehard
   successfully, you will need to compile and build both of the f2c
   libraries, and then compile with a command line like
   
   cc -o diehard diehard.c -lf2c -lm
   
   For further information, look at the readme file. (Sorry, neither we,
   nor Professor Marsaglia, can provide any support on this. We've
   succeeded in doing it, so we know it can be done.)
   
   Much easier than recompiling is to use one of the precompiled versions
   of the executable files that are supplied for the following machine
   types:
     * DOS
     * Sun
     * LINUX
     * DEC Alpha AXP
       
   Also included from Marsaglia's CDROM are four PostScript files that
   contain information on the CDROM itself, and additional information on
   random number generators.
   
   A word of caution about the files canada.bit, germany.bit, and
   calif.bit, included in this directory. As Marsaglia explains, these
   files do not pass all tests for randomness, but are included for their
   usefulness in demonstrating Diehard, or in assessing other routines
   for finding nonrandomness.

   Please note that Professor Marsaglia is in no way responsible for the
   files of random bytes that are included elsewhere on this CDROM. Those
   files in fact do pass the Diehard tests, but they are the result of an
   independent effort, not related to the Marsaglia CDROM.
