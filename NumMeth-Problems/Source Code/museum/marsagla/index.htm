Professor Marsaglia's CDROM, based on research supported by the National
Science Foundation under grants DMS-8807976 and DMS-9206972, contains
approximately 600 Mbytes of files of random bytes that pass all known
tests for randomness.  <b>Those files are not included on this CDROM.</b>
Here is the top level <a href="cdrom.txt">readme file</a> from
Marsaglia's full CDROM.<p>

The files included on this CDROM relate to Marsaglia's rightly famous, if
whimsically named, "Diehard battery of tests of randomness".  These have
come be viewed as something of an industry standard for testing
random number generators.  Over the years, several generators thought to
be good have been shown to be inadequate by these tests.<p>

Here is a <a href="source/">directory of source files</a>
(or, Mac <a href="source.htm">alternate listing</a>)
for the Diehard tests.  The principal program needed is
<a href="source/diehard.c"><tt>diehard.c</tt></a>.  Note that this is a
C program automatically translated from the original Fortran by the
program "f2c" (included <a href="../slatec/f2c/f2c_src/">elsewhere</a>
on this CDROM.
To compile Diehard successfully, you will need to compile and build
both of the <a href="../slatec/f2c/lib/">f2c libraries</a>, and
then compile with a command line like<p>
<tt>cc -o diehard diehard.c -lf2c -lm</tt><p>
For further information, look at the <a href="source/readme.txt">readme
file</a>. (Sorry, neither we, nor Professor Marsaglia, can provide any
support on this.  We've succeeded in doing it, so we know it <i>can</i>
be done.)<p>

You may find it easier to modify and compile the <a
href="source/diehard.f">original Fortran version (diehard.f)</a>, also
included by permission of Professor Marsaglia, but with the strict
understanding that it be treated as a well-tested "working
composite code," with 30 years of accumulated patches; it is not
polished code intended for public release.<p>

Much easier than recompiling is to use one of the precompiled versions
of the executable files that are supplied for the following machine types:

<menu>
<li><a href="dos/">DOS</a>
<li><a href="sun/">Sun</a>
<li><a href="linux/">LINUX</a>
<li><a href="decaxp/">DEC Alpha AXP</a>
</menu>

Also included from Marsaglia's CDROM are four
<a href="pscript/">PostScript files</a>
(Mac <a href="pscript.htm">alternate listing</a>)
that contain information
on the CDROM itself, and additional information on random number
generators.<p>

A word of caution about
the files <tt>canada.bit</tt>, <tt>germany.bit</tt>, and
<tt>calif.bit</tt>, included in <a href="./">this directory</a>.
As Marsaglia explains, these files do <b>not</b> pass all tests
for randomness, but are included for their usefulness in demonstrating
Diehard, or in assessing other routines for finding nonrandomness.<p>

<hr>

Please note that Professor Marsaglia is in no way responsible for
the files of random bytes that are included
<a href="../random/index.htm">elsewhere</a>
on this CDROM.  Those files in fact do pass the Diehard tests, but they
are the result of an independent effort, not related to the Marsaglia CDROM.<p>
