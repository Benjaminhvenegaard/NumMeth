The files flip.c (PC executable flip.exe) and flip.pl (PERL script)
are utilities for changing the end-of-line characters in text files to
any of the following three conventions:

PC   lines end with ^M^J (carriage-return line-feed)
Mac  lines end with ^M   (carriage-return)
UNIX lines end with ^J   (line-feed)

flip.c is a "vanilla" C program that should compile on most machines.
Its principal restriction is that it cannot recurse into
subdirectories, though (on most systems) it can do multiple files in a
single directory with wildcard arguments.

flip.exe is flip.c compiled with Microsoft C/C++ V1.52.  This should
run on all DOS and Windows machines.  Use the command line "FLIP.EXE"
to get a usage summary.

flip.pl is a PERL script, with the additional feature that it can
recurse into subdirectories, if desired.  To use flip.pl, you will
need already to have PERL on your machine.  Depending on your setup,
you might run flip.pl with a command line like "PERL FLIP.PL
<filename>".
