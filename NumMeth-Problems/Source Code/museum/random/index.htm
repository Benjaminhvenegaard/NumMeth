Included on this CDROM are 20 files each containing 1677216 (that's
2^24) random bytes, physically generated and algorithmically
"perfected".  That's more than 2.6 Gigabits of unique randomness!<p>

Here are links to:

<ul>
<li><a href="files/">the directory</a> containing the 20 files
<li><a href="doc/readme.htm">a detailed description</a> of how the files
were generated
<li>files <a href="doc/getran.c">getran.c</a> and
<a href="doc/testran.c">testran.c</a> which implement and test a simple
server of stored random numbers to C programs
<li>file <a href="doc/getran.txt">getran.txt</a>, a UNIX-style man page
that explains the previous two files
</ul>

The 20 files of random values, and the files getran.c, testran.c, and
getran.txt are placed, herewith, into the public domain, without
any warranty whatsoever. They may be freely copied or redistributed.
Sorry, we can't provide any support on getran.c or testran.c, other than
supplying the above files, as-is.<p>

<hr>

Please note that there is no relation between the random files supplied
here and those published on the "Marsaglia Random Number CDROM".
Professor Marsaglia has kindly given permission for us to include
his tests for randomness (which the files here all pass, incidentally)
<a href="../marsagla/index.htm">elsewhere</a> on this CDROM.<p>
