              GUIDE TO NUMERICAL RECIPES FILES OF RANDOM NUMBERS
                                       
   Included on this CDROM are 20 files each containing 1677216 (that's
   2^24) random bytes, physically generated and algorithmically
   "perfected". That's more than 2.6 Gigabits of unique randomness!
   
   Here are links to:
     * the directory containing the 20 files
     * a detailed description of how the files were generated
     * files getran.c and testran.c which implement and test a simple
       server of stored random numbers to C programs
     * file getran.txt, a UNIX-style man page that explains the previous
       two files
       
   The 20 files of random values, and the files getran.c, testran.c, and
   getran.txt are placed, herewith, into the public domain, without any
   warranty whatsoever. They may be freely copied or redistributed.
   Sorry, we can't provide any support on getran.c or testran.c, other
   than supplying the above files, as-is.

   Please note that there is no relation between the random files
   supplied here and those published on the "Marsaglia Random Number
   CDROM". Professor Marsaglia has kindly given permission for us to
   include his tests for randomness (which the files here all pass,
   incidentally) elsewhere on this CDROM.
