BRIEF DESCRIPTION:

    THIS SECTION CONTAINS TWO  PREPARATORY  PROCEDURES  FOR THE
    SOLUTION  OF  SYSTEMS  OF  LINEAR  ALGEBRAIC  EQUATIONS  WITH A
    TRIDIAGONAL  MATRIX;
    DECTRI  PERFORMS  A  TRIANGULAR  DECOMPOSITION  OF  A  TRIDIAGONAL
    MATRIX.
    DECTRIPIV  PERFORMS A TRIANGULAR DECOMPOSITION OF A TRIDIAGONAL
    MATRIX, USING PARTIAL PIVOTING TO STABILIZE THE PROCESS.

KEYWORDS:

    LU DECOMPOSITION,
    TRIANGULAR DECOMPOSITION,
    TRIDIAGONAL MATRIX.

CALLING SEQUENCE:

    THE HEADING OF THIS PROCEDURE IS:
    "PROCEDURE" DECTRI(SUB, DIAG, SUPER, N, AUX);
    "VALUE" N; "INTEGER" N; "ARRAY" SUB, DIAG, SUPER, AUX;
    "CODE" 34423;

    THE MEANING OF THE FORMAL PARAMETERS IS:
    SUB:    &lt;ARRAY IDENTIFIER&gt;;
            "ARRAY" SUB[1: N - 1];
            ENTRY:  THE  SUBDIAGONAL   OF  THE  GIVEN  MATRIX  T,  SAY;
                    T[I + 1, I]  SHOULD   BE  GIVEN  IN  SUB[I], I = 1,
                    ..., N - 1;
            EXIT:   SUPPOSE L DENOTES THE LOWER-BIDIAGONAL MATRIX, SUCH
                    THAT  LU = T,  FOR SOME UPPER-BIDIAGONAL MATRIX  U,
                    WITH UNIT DIAGONAL ELEMENTS, THEN L[I + 1, I]  WILL
                    BE DELIVERED IN SUB[I], I = 1, ..., AUX[3] - 1;

    DIAG:   &lt;ARRAY IDENTIFIER&gt;;
            "ARRAY" DIAG[1: N];
            ENTRY:  THE DIAGONAL OF T;
            EXIT:   L[I, I] WILL BE DELIVERED IN  DIAG[I],  I = 1, ...,
                    AUX[3];
    SUPER:  &lt;ARRAY IDENTIFIER&gt;;
            "ARRAY" SUPER[1: N - 1];
            ENTRY:  THE SUPERDIAGONAL OF T; T[I, I + 1] SHOULD BE GIVEN
                    IN SUPER[I], I = 1, ..., N - 1;
            EXIT:   U[I, I + 1]  WILL BE DELIVERED IN  SUPER[I], I = 1,
                    ..., AUX[3] - 1;
    N:      &lt;ARITHMETICAL EXPRESSION&gt;;
            THE ORDER OF THE MATRIX;
    AUX:    &lt;ARRAY IDENTIFIER&gt;;
            "ARRAY" AUX[2:5];
            ENTRY :
            AUX[2]: A RELATIVE TOLERANCE;  A REASONABLE CHOICE FOR THIS
                    VALUE IS AN ESTIMATE OF  THE RELATIVE PRECISION  OF
                    THE  MATRIX ELEMENTS,  HOWEVER, IT  SHOULD  NOT  BE
                    CHOSEN SMALLER THAN THE MACHINE PRECISION;
            EXIT:
            AUX[3]: THE NUMBER OF ELIMINATION STEPS PERFORMED;
            AUX[5]: IF AUX[3] = N, THEN AUX[5] WILL EQUAL THE INFINITY-
                    NORM OF THE MATRIX,  ELSE  AUX[5]  IS SET  EQUAL TO
                    THE  VALUE  OF  THAT  ELEMENT   WHICH   CAUSES  THE
                    BREAKDOWN OF THE DECOMPOSITION.

PROCEDURES USED: NONE.

LANGUAGE:   ALGOL 60.

METHOD AND PERFORMANCE:

    THE METHOD USED IN DECTRI YIELDS A LOWER-BIDIAGONAL MATRIX L  AND A
    UNIT UPPER-BIDIAGONAL MATRIX U, SUCH THAT THE PRODUCT LU EQUALS THE
    GIVEN TRIDIAGONAL MATRIX;  THE PROCESS  IS TERMINATED  IN THE  K-TH
    STEP, IF THE MODULUS OF THE K-TH DIAGONAL ELEMENT IS SMALLER THAN A
    CERTAIN SMALL VALUE,  WHICH IS GIVEN BY  AUX[2]  MULTIPLIED BY  THE
    1-NORM OF THE K-TH ROW; IN THIS CASE AUX[3] WILL BE GIVEN THE VALUE
    K - 1  AND  AUX[5]  WILL BE GIVEN  THE VALUE  OF  THE K-TH DIAGONAL
    ELEMENT.

PROCEDURES USED: NONE.

LANGUAGE:   ALGOL 60.

METHOD AND PERFORMANCE:

    THE METHOD USED IN DECTRIPIV YIELDS A LOWER-BIDIAGONAL MATRIX L AND
    A UNIT UPPER-TRIANGULAR MATRIX  U  WITH TWO CODIAGONALS,  SUCH THAT
    THE PRODUCT  LU  EQUALS THE GIVEN TRIDIAGONAL MATRIX  WITH PERMUTED
    ROWS; PARTIAL PIVOTING IS USED DURING THE TRIANGULAR DECOMPOSITION,
    I.E. THAT ELEMENT OF THE K-TH COLUMN OF L IS CHOSEN AS PIVOT IN THE
    K-TH STEP, WHOSE MODULUS DIVIDED BY THE 1-NORM OF THE CORRESPONDING
    ROW OF THE GIVEN MATRIX IS MAXIMAL;  THE PROCESS  IS TERMINATED  IN
    THE K-TH STEP,  IF THE MODULUS OF  THE K-TH  PIVOT ELEMENT  IS LESS
    THAN A CERTAIN SMALL VALUE, WHICH IS GIVEN BY AUX[2]  MULTIPLIED BY
    THE 1-NORM OF THE  CORRESPONDING ROW;  IN THIS CASE  AUX[3] WILL BE
    GIVEN THE VALUE  K - 1, AND  AUX[5]  WILL BE GIVEN THE VALUE OF THE
    K-TH PIVOT ELEMENT.
