BEGIN SECTION : 6.1 (January, 1976)

AUTHOR: D.T.WINTER.

INSTITUTE: MATHEMATICAL CENTRE.

RECEIVED: 751208.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION:
    THIS SECTION CONTAINS TWO PROCEDURES:
    1)  PI: DELIVERS THE VALUE OF PI;
    2)  E:  DELIVERS THE VALUE OF E.

KEYWORDS:

    MATHEMATICAL CONSTANTS
    PI
    E

<a name="PI"></a>
SUBSECTION: PI

CALLING SEQUENCE:

    THE HEADING OF THE PROCEDURE IS:
    "REAL" "PROCEDURE" PI;
    "CODE" 30006;

    PI:= THE CONSTANT PI IN 48 BITS PRECISION.

LANGUAGE: COMPASS

<a name="E"></a>
SUBSECTION: E

CALLING SEQUENCE:

    THE HEADING OF THE PROCEDURE IS:
    "REAL" "PROCEDURE" E;
    "CODE" 30007;

    E:= THE CONSTANT E IN 48 BITS PRECISION.

LANGUAGE: COMPASS

SOURCE TEXTS:
 THE SOURCE TEXTS  GIVEN HERE  ARE NOT THE ACTUAL  SOURCE TEXTS,  AS
 THESE PROCEDURES ARE WRITTEN IN COMPASS. EVEN, THE TEXTS GIVEN
 HERE DO NOT GIVE THE SAME RESULTS ON THE CDC CYBER SYSTEM, SINCE
 THE ALGOL-60 COMPILER CANNOT READ THE CONSTANTS IN 48 BIT PRECISION.
