BRIEF DESCRIPTION:

    THIS SECTION CONTAINS FOUR PROCEDURES:
    A) CHLSOL2, FOR THE SOLUTION OF A SYSTEM OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IF THE
    COEFFICIENT MATRIX HAS BEEN DECOMPOSED BY A CALL OF THE PROCEDURE
    CHLDEC2, SECTION 3.1.1.1.1.2.1., OR CHLDECSOL2;
    B) CHLSOL1, FOR THE SOLUTION OF A SYSTEM OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IF THE
    COEFFICIENT MATRIX HAS BEEN DECOMPOSED BY A CALL OF THE PROCEDURE
    CHLDEC1, SECTION 3.1.1.1.1.2.1., OR CHLDECSOL1;
    C) CHLDECSOL2, FOR THE SOLUTION OF A SYSTEM OF LINEAR EQUATIONS BY
    CHOLESKY'S SQUARE ROOT METHOD;
    THE COEFFICIENT MATRIX HAS TO BE SYMMETRIC POSITIVE DEFINITE AND
    MUST BE GIVEN IN THE UPPER TRIANGLE OF A TWO-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY;
    D) CHLDECSOL1, FOR THE SOLUTION OF A SYSTEM OF LINEAR EQUATIONS BY
    CHOLESKY'S SQUARE ROOT METHOD;
    THE COEFFICIENT MATRIX HAS TO BE SYMMETRIC POSITIVE DEFINITE AND
    MUST BE GIVEN COLUMNWISE IN A ONE-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY.

KEYWORDS:

                   AS  PRODUCED BY CHLDEC2, SECTION  3.1.1.1.1.2.1., OR
                   CHLDECSOL2  (THIS  SECTION), MUST  BE  GIVEN IN  THE

LANGUAGE: ALGOL 60.

METHOD AND PERFORMANCE:

    THE PROCEDURE CHLSOL2 CALCULATES THE SOLUTION OF A SYSTEM OF LINEAR
    EQUATIONS, PROVIDED THAT THE COEFFICIENT MATRIX HAS BEEN DECOMPOSED
    BY A SUCCESSFUL CALL OF CHLDEC2 OR CHLDECSOL2;
    THE SOLUTION IS OBTAINED BY CARRYING OUT THE FORWARD AND BACK
    SUBSTITUTION WITH THE CHOLESKY MATRIX AND THE RIGHT HAND SIDE.
    THE RIGHT HAND SIDE IS OVERWRITTEN BY THE SOLUTION BUT THE
    ELEMENTS OF THE CHOLESKY MATRIX ARE NOT CHANGED, THUS SEVERAL
    SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS WITH THE SAME COEFFICIENT MATRIX BUT
    DIFFERENT RIGHT HAND SIDES CAN BE SOLVED BY SUCCESSIVE CALLS OF
    CHLSOL2. SEE ALSO REF [1].
