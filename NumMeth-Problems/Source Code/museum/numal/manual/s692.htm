      OF ORDER ZERO WITH ARGUMENT X;

    BESS I1;
      COMPUTES THE MODIFIED BESSEL FUNCTION OF THE FIRST KIND
      OF ORDER ONE WITH ARGUMENT X;

      FIRST KIND OF ORDER L (L = 0, ..., N) WITH ARGUMENT X;

    BESS K01;
      COMPUTES THE MODIFIED BESSEL FUNCTIONS OF THE THIRD KIND
      OF ORDERS ZERO AND ONE WITH ARGUMENT X; X &gt; 0;

    BESS K;

      KIND OF ORDER L ( L = 0, ..., N) WITH ARGUMENT X; X &gt; 0;

    NONEXP BESS I0;
      DOES THE SAME AS BESS I0, BUT THE RESULT IS MULTIPLIED
      BY EXP(-ABS(X));

      BY EXP(-ABS(X));

      DOES THE SAME AS BESS I, BUT THE ARRAY ELEMENTS ARE
      MULTIPLIED BY EXP(-ABS(X));

SUBSECTION: NONEXP BESS K.

CALLING SEQUENCE:

    THE HEADING OF THE PROCEDURE READS:
    "PROCEDURE" NONEXP BESS K(X, N,K); "VALUE" X, N;
    "INTEGER" N; "REAL" X; "ARRAY" K;
    "CODE" 35179;

    THE MEANING OF THE FORMAL PARAMETERS IS:
    X:  &lt;ARITHMETIC EXPRESSION&gt;;
        THE ARGUMENT OF THE BESSEL FUNCTIONS; X &gt; 0;
    N:  &lt;ARITHMETIC EXPRESSION&gt;;
        THE UPPER BOUND OF THE INDICES OF THE ARRAY K; N &gt;= 0;
    K:  &lt;ARRAY IDENTIFIER&gt;;
        "ARRAY" K[0:N];
        EXIT: K[I] POSSESSES THE VALUE OF THE MODIFIED BESSEL
              FUNCTION OF THE THIRD KIND OF ORDER I (I = 0, ..., N)
              MULTIPLIED BY EXP(X).

PROCEDURES USED:

    NONEXP BESS K01  = CP 35178.

REQUIRED CENTRAL MEMORY: NO AUXILIARY ARRAYS ARE USED.

METHOD AND PERFORMANCE:
    K[0] AND K[1] ARE COMPUTED BY USING NONEXP BESS K01 (CP 35178),
    WHILE K[2], ..., K[N] ARE COMPUTED ACCORDING TO THE
    RECURRENCE RELATION
    K[I+1]=K[I]+(2*I/X)*K[I], I&gt;=2
    (SEE [1], P. 376, FORMULA 9.6.26).
