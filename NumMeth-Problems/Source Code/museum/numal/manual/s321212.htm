BRIEF DESCRIPTION:

    THIS SECTION  CONTAINS THREE PROCEDURES.
    A) TFMREAHES TRANSFORMS A MATRIX INTO A SIMILAR  UPPER-HESSENBERG
    MATRIX BY MEANS OF WILKINSON'S TRANSFORMATION,
    B) BAKREAHES1  PERFORMS  THE  CORRESPONDING  BACK TRANSFORMATION ON
    A VECTOR AND SHOULD BE CALLED AFTER TFMREAHES,
    C) BAKREAHES2  PERFORMS  THE  CORRESPONDING  BACK TRANSFORMATION ON
    THE COLUMNS OF A MATRIX AND SHOULD BE CALLED AFTER TFMREAHES.

KEYWORDS:

    SIMILARITY TRANSFORMATION,
    UPPER-HESSENBERG MATRIX.

SUBSECTION: TFMREAHES.

CALLING SEQUENCE:

    THE HEADING OF THE PROCEDURE IS:
    "PROCEDURE" TFMREAHES(A, N, EM, INT); "VALUE" N;
    "INTEGER" N; "ARRAY" A, EM; "INTEGER" "ARRAY" INT;
    "CODE" 34170;

    THE MEANING OF THE FORMAL PARAMETERS IS:
    N:      &lt;ARITHMETIC EXPRESSION&gt;;
            THE ORDER OF THE GIVEN MATRIX;
    A:      &lt;ARRAY IDENTIFIER&gt;;
            "ARRAY"A[1:N,1:N];
            ENTRY:  THE MATRIX TO BE TRANSFORMED;
            EXIT:   THE UPPER-HESSENBERG MATRIX IS  DELIVERED IN  THE
                    UPPER TRIANGLE AND THE FIRST  SUBDIAGONAL OF A, THE
                    (NONTRIVIAL ELEMENTS OF THE) TRANSFORMING   MATRIX,
                    L, IN  THE  REMAINING  PART OF A, I.E. A[I,J] =
                    L[I,J + 1], FOR I = 3,...,N AND J = 1,...,I - 2;
    EM:     &lt;ARRAY IDENTIFIER&gt;;
            "ARRAY"EM[0:1];
            ENTRY:  EM[0], THE MACHINE PRECISION;
            EXIT:   EM[1], THE INFINITY NORM OF THE ORIGINAL MATRIX;
    INT:    &lt;ARRAY IDENTIFIER&gt;;
            "INTEGER""ARRAY" INT[1:N];
            EXIT:   THE PIVOTAL INDICES DEFINING  THE  STABILIZING  ROW
                    AND COLUMN INTERCHANGES;

PROCEDURES USED:
    MATVEC          =      CP34011,
    MATMAT          =      CP34013,
    ICHCOL          =      CP34031,
    ICHROW          =      CP34032.

REQUIRED CENTRAL MEMORY:
    EXECUTION FIELD LENGTH:
            A  ONE-DIMENSIONAL REAL ARRAY OF LENGTH N IS DECLARED.

RUNNING TIME: ROUGHLY PROPORTIONAL TO N CUBED.

LANGUAGE:   ALGOL 60.

METHOD AND PERFORMANCE:
    WILKINSON'S   TRANSFORMATION   IS   A TRIANGULAR       SIMILARITY
    TRANSFORMATION   WITH   STABILIZING  ROW  AND  COLUMN  INTERCHANGES
    TRANSFORMING  A  MATRIX, M, INTO  AN UPPER-HESSENBERG  MATRIX, H.
    THE TRANSFORMING MATRIX IS THE PRODUCT OF A PERMUTATION  MATRIX, P,
    AND A UNIT LOWER-TRIANGULAR MATRIX, L. THE NONDIAGONAL ELEMENTS  IN
    THE FIRST COLUMN OF L ARE 0, AND THE  ROW  AND  COLUMN INTERCHANGES
    ARE CHOSEN IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE  ABSOLUTE  VALUE OF EACH  ELEMENT
    OF L IS AT MOST 1.
    BECAUSE  OF  THE SPECIAL  FORM  OF L, THE  MATRICES H AND L CAN  BE
    STORED TOGETHER  IN  THE  ARRAY  USED FOR THE MATRIX M (SEE CALLING
    SEQUENCE). FOR FURTHER DETAILS SEE REFERENCE [1] AND [2].

    "CODE" 34171;

    THE MEANING OF THE FORMAL PARAMETERS IS:
    N:      &lt;ARITHMETIC EXPRESSION&gt;;
            THE LENGTH OF THE VECTOR TO BE TRANSFORMED;
    A:      &lt;ARRAY IDENTIFIER&gt;;
            "ARRAY"A[1:N,1:N];
            ENTRY:  THE (NONTRIVIAL  ELEMENTS  OF  THE)    TRANSFORMING
                    MATRIX, L, AS PRODUCED BY TFMREAHES MUST  BE  GIVEN
                    IN THE PART  BELOW  THE  FIRST  SUBDIAGONAL  OF  A,
                    I.E. A[I,J] = L[I,J + 1], FOR I = 3,...,N   AND

METHOD AND PERFORMANCE:
    THE    BACK  TRANSFORMATION  WHICH  CORRESPONDS  TO   WILKINSON'S
    TRANSFORMATION AS PERFORMED BY TFMREAHES  TRANSFORMS  A  VECTOR, X,
    INTO THE VECTOR PLX, WHERE PL IS THE TRANSFORMING MATRIX.
