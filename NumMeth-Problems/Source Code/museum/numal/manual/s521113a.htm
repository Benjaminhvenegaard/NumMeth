BRIEF DESCRIPTION:

    MODIFIED TAYLOR SOLVES AN INITIAL ( BOUNDARY ) VALUE PROBLEM, GIVEN
    AS A SYSTEM  OF  FIRST ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS , BY MEANS OF A
    ONE-STEP TAYLOR-METHOD.
    IN PARTICULAR THIS METHOD IS SUITABLE FOR THE INTEGRATION OF  LARGE
    SYSTEMS ARISING FROM PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS , PROVIDED THAT
    HIGHER ORDER DERIVATIVES CAN BE EASILY OBTAINED.

KEYWORDS:

    DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS,
    INITIAL (BOUNDARY) VALUE PROBLEMS,
    ONE-STEP TAYLOR-METHOD.

DATA AND RESULTS:

    FOR FURTHER EXPLANATION OF THE PARAMETERS AETA, RETA, ETA, RHO, M0,
    M AND THE ARRAY DATA SEE REFERENCES [2] AND [3].
    AS  FOR  THE  INDICES  M0 AND M THE FOLLOWING MAY BE REMARKED: WHEN
    THE METHOD OF LINES IS APPLIED TO HYPERBOLIC DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
    THE NUMBER OF  RELEVANT  ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS  DECREASES
    DURING THE INTEGRATION PROCESS.
    IN PROCEDURE MODIFIED TAYLOR , THIS  MAY  BE  REALIZED  BY  INTEGER
    PROCEDURES M0 AND M WHICH  ARE  DEFINED  AS  FUNCTIONS OF I, K  AND
    DATA[-2].

PROCEDURES USED: VECVEC = CP34010.

REQUIRED CENTRAL MEMORY:

    EXECUTION FIELD LENGTH: CIRCA 75 + M - M0.

RUNNING TIME:

    DEPENDS  STRONGLY  ON  THE  DIFFERENTIAL  EQUATION  TO  BE  SOLVED.

LANGUAGE: ALGOL 60.
