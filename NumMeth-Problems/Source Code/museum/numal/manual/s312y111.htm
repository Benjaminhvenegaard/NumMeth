    ELMVEC = CP34020,
    ICHVEC = CP34030.

REQUIRED CENTRAL MEMORY    :

    EXECUTION FIELD LENGTH  : A REAL ARRAY OF N ELEMENTS IS DECLARED.

RUNNING TIME   :

    (C1 * LW + C2) * (LW + RW + 1) * N;
    THE CONSTANTS C1 AND C2 DEPEND UPON THE
    ARITHMETIC OF THE COMPUTER.

LANGUAGE       :    ALGOL 60.

METHOD AND PERFORMANCE :

    DECBND PERFORMS THE DECOMPOSITION OF A MATRIX WHOSE NON-ZERO
    ELEMENTS ARE IN BAND FORM, AND WHOSE BAND ELEMENTS ARE STORED
    ROWWISE IN A ONE-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY.
    THE METHOD USED IS GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION WITH STABILIZING ROW
    INTERCHANGES (PARTIAL PIVOTING).
    THE GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION IS PERFORMED IN N STEPS. IN THE K-TH
    STEP, K = 1, ... , N, A PIVOT IS SELECTED IN THE K-TH COLUMN OF
    THE REMAINING SUBMATRIX OF ORDER N - K + 1 (THIS COLUMN
    CONTAINS AT MOST LW + 1 NON-ZERO ELEMENTS); THEN THE PIVOTAL
    ROW IS INTERCHANGED WITH THE K-TH ROW; SUBSEQUENTLY THE K-TH
    UNKNOWN IS ELIMINATED IN THE LAST N - K ROWS (ONLY THE FIRST
    LW OF THESE LAST ROWS ARE INVOLVED HERE).
    THE PIVOT IS SELECTED IN SUCH A WAY THAT ITS ABSOLUTE
    VALUE DIVIDED BY THE EUCLIDEAN NORM OF THE CORRESPONDING ROW OF
    THE MATRIX IS MAXIMAL. THUS, THE MATRIX IS EQUILIBRATED IN THIS
    PIVOTING STRATEGY SUCH, THAT THE ROWS EFFECTIVELY OBTAIN UNIT
    EUCLIDEAN NORM.
    THE PROCEDURE DELIVERS THE BAND ELEMENTS OF THE ELIMINATED MATRIX
    (WHICH IS AN UPPER TRIANGULAR MATRIX WITH LW + RW
    SUPERDIAGONALS) AND THE GAUSSIAN MULTIPLIERS FOR EACH ELIMINATION
    .
    THE ELIMINATION CANNOT BE CARRIED OUT IF THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF THE
    PIVOT IS LESS THAN A GIVEN RELATIVE TOLERANCE (AUX[2]) TIMES THE
    EUCLIDEAN NORM OF THE CORRESPONDING ROW OF THE MATRIX. THEN THE
    PREVIOUS STEP NUMBER OF THE ELIMINATION IS DELIVERED (IN AUX[3],
    WHICH ELSE TAKES THE VALUE N).  SEE ALSO REF [1], SECTION 212.
