BRIEF DESCRIPTION:

    THIS SECTION CONTAINS  FIVE  PROCEDURES  FOR INVERSION OF MATRICES:
    INV CALCULATES THE INVERSE OF A MATRIX THAT HAS BEEN TRIANGULARLY
    DECOMPOSED BY DEC;
    DECINV CALCULATES THE INVERSE OF A MATRIX WHOSE ORDER IS SMALL
    RELATIVE  TO  THE  NUMBER  OF  BINARY  DIGITS  IN  THE  NUMBER
    REPRESENTATION;
    INV1 CALCULATES THE INVERSE OF A MATRIX THAT HAS BEEN TRIANGULARLY
    DECOMPOSED BY GSSELM OR GSSERB.THE 1-NORM OF THE INVERSE MATRIX
    MIGHT ALSO BE CALCULATED
    GSSINV CALCULATES THE INVERSE OF A MATRIX;
    GSSINVERB CALCULATES THE INVERSE OF A MATRIX AND ITS 1-NORM.
    A ROUGH UPPERBOUND FOR THE RELATIVE ERROR IN THE CALCULATED INVERSE
    MATRIX IS ALSO GIVEN;

    THE DIFFERENCE
    BETWEEN  DECINV  ON THE ONE SIDE AND  GSSINV  AND  GSSINVERB ON THE
    OTHER SIDE  LIES IN THE METHOD  USED  FOR TRIANGULAR DECOMPOSITION,
    PARTICULARLY IN THE PIVOTING STRATEGY;  DECINV USES DEC, GSSINV AND
    GSSINVERB  USE  GSSELM TO PERFORM THE TRIANGULAR DECOMPOSITION; THE
    USER  IS  ADVISED  TO  USE   GSSINV  OR   GSSINVERB   (SEE  SECTION
    3.1.1.1.1.1.1).

PROCEDURES USED:

    DEC = CP34300,
    INV = CP34053.

REQUIRED CENTRAL MEMORY:

METHOD AND PERFORMANCE:

    DECINV  USES  DEC (SECTION 3.1.1.1.1.1.1) TO PERFORM THE TRIANGULAR
    DECOMPOSITION OF A MATRIX AND INV TO CALCULATE ITS INVERSE;  DECINV
    SHOULD ONLY BE USED IF THE ORDER OF THE MATRIX IS SMALL RELATIVE TO
    THE NUMBER OF BINARY DIGITS IN THE NUMBER REPRESENTATION (SEE DEC);
    IF AUX[3] &lt; N, THEN THE EFFECT OF DECINV IS MERELY THAT OF DEC.
