                        MAY BE  USEFUL TO  START  AGAIN  WITH  A HIGHER

PROCEDURES USED:

    DWARF   = CP30003;
    GIANT   = CP30004;
    COMABS  = CP34340;
    COMSQRT = CP34343;

REQUIRED CENTRAL MEMORY:

    TOTAL SIZE OF LOCAL ARRAYS IS N + 16 REAL LOCATIONS;

RUNNING TIME:

    ROUGHLY PROPORTIONAL TO N**2;

METHOD AND PERFORMANCE:

    THE  PROCEDURE  USES  LAGUERRE'S  METHOD TO FIND ZEROS OF THE GIVEN
    POLYNOMIAL (SEE [2]);  WHEN A ZERO HAS BEEN FOUND, A COMPOSITE
    DEFLATION TECHNIQUE IS USED TO  OBTAIN A  NEW POLYNOMIAL OF LOWER
    DEGREE (SEE [1], [3], [4]); IF CONVERGENCE IS NOT APPARENT, SEVERAL
    RESTARTS, THE NUMBER OF WHICH DEPENDS ON  EM[1]  BUT HAS A MAXIMUM
    OF  5, ARE MADE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE ABSOLUTE LARGEST ZERO;
    THE  ACCURACY OF THE  CALCULATED  ZEROS  STRONGLY  DEPENDS  ON  THE
    POLYNOMIAL; A ROUGH INDICATION FOR THE ERROR IN A CALCULATED ZERO Z
    FOLLOWS FROM P(Z) / DP(Z), WHERE P DENOTES THE GIVEN POLYNOMIAL AND
    DP ITS  FIRST DERIVATIVE (SEE E.G. [5]); TO FIND A  TRUE UPPERBOUND
    FOR THESE ERRORS, ONE CAN USE PROCEDURE BOUNDS (SEE NEXT
    SUBSECTION); FOR  A MORE  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE AND
    TEST RESULTS SEE [4];

RUNNING TIME:

    APPROXIMATELY OF ORDER N**2;

METHOD AND PERFORMANCE:

    FROM  THE  APPROXIMATED  ZEROS  A  POLYNOMIAL IS  RECONSTRUCTED AND
    COMPARED  WITH  THE  GIVEN  POLYNOMIAL; SUBSEQUENTLY, THE PROCEDURE
    CALCULATES  DISKS  SUCH THAT THE NUMBER OF GIVEN APPROXIMATED ZEROS
    WITHIN EACH DISK EQUALS THE NUMBER OF ZEROS OF THE GIVEN POLYNOMIAL
    WITHIN  THAT  DISK;  UPON  EXIT  EVERY  TWO NON-IDENTICAL DISKS ARE
    DISJOINT;
