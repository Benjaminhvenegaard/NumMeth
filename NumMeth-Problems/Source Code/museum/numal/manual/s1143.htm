AUTHOR: D.T.WINTER.

INSTITUTE: MATHEMATICAL CENTRE.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION:

    THIS SECTION CONTAINS PROCEDURES  THAT MULTIPLY A GIVEN MATRIX BY A
    (GENERALIZED) HOUSEHOLDER MATRIX, I.E. A MATRIX M = I + X * U * U',
    WHERE  I  IS THE UNIT MATRIX,   X  A REAL CONSTANT AND  U  A VECTOR
    (CALLED THE HOUSEHOLDER CONSTANT AND HOUSEHOLDER VECTOR,
    RESPECTIVELY)

    HSHVECMAT  PREMULTIPLIES  A  MATRIX BY A HOUSEHOLDER MATRIX, THE
               HOUSEHOLDER VECTOR HAS BEEN STORED
               IN A ONE-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY.
    HSHCOLMAT  PREMULTIPLIES  A  MATRIX BY A HOUSEHOLDER MATRIX,
               THE HOUSEHOLDER VECTOR HAS BEEN STORED AS A COLUMN
               IN A TWO-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY.
    HSHROWMAT  PREMULTIPLIES  A  MATRIX BY A HOUSEHOLDER MATRIX,
               THE HOUSEHOLDER VECTOR HAS BEEN STORED AS A ROW
               IN A TWO-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY.
    HSHVECTAM  POSTMULTIPLIES  A  MATRIX BY A HOUSEHOLDER MATRIX,
               THE HOUSEHOLDER VECTOR HAS BEEN STORED
               IN A ONE-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY.
    HSHCOLTAM  POSTMULTIPLIES  A  MATRIX BY A HOUSEHOLDER MATRIX,
               THE HOUSEHOLDER VECTOR HAS BEEN STORED
               AS A COLUMN IN A TWO-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY.
    HSHROWTAM  POSTMULTIPLIES  A  MATRIX BY A HOUSEHOLDER MATRIX,
               THE HOUSEHOLDER VECTOR HAS BEEN STORED
               AS A ROW IN A TWO-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY.
