BRIEF DESCRIPTION:
    THIS SECTION  CONTAINS  SIX  PROCEDURES:
    A: DEC PERFORMS A TRIANGULAR DECOMPOSITION WITH PARTIAL PIVOTING;
    B: GSSELM PERFORMS A TRIANGULAR DECOMPOSITION WITH A COMBINATION OF
       PARTIAL AND COMPLETE PIVOTING;
    C: ONENRMINV DELIVERS THE 1-NORM OF THE INVERSE OF A MATRIX WHOSE
      TRIANGULARLY DECOMPOSED FORM HAS BEEN DELIVERED BY DEC OR GSSELM;
    D:ERBELM CALCULATES A ROUGH UPPERBOUND FOR THE SOLUTION OF A LINEAR
       SYSTEM WHOSE MATRIX IS TRIANGULARLY DECOMPOSED BY GSSELM;
    E: GSSERB PERFORMS A TRIANGULAR DECOMPOSTION OF THE MATRIX OF A
      LINEAR SYSTEM AND CALCULATES AN UPPERBOUND FOR THE RELATIVE ERROR
       OF THE SOLUTION OF THAT SYSTEM;
    F: GSSNRI PERFORMS A TRIANGULAR DECOMPOSITION AND CALCULATES THE
       1-NORM OF THE INVERSE MATRIX;

    THE METHOD USED IN DEC AND GSSELM YIELDS A LOWER-TRIANGULAR MATRIX
    L AND A UNIT UPPER-TRIANGULAR MATRIX U SUCH THAT THE PRODUCT
    LU EQUALS THE GIVEN MATRIX WITH PERMUTED ROWS (DEC) OR ROWS AND
    COLUMNS (GSSELM); IN DEC, ONLY PARTIAL PIVOTING IS USED ([3],
    [4, P.115], [5, P.201]); THE PIVOTING STRATEGY IN GSSELM IS
    A COMBINATION OF PARTIAL AND COMPLETE PIVOTING ([2], [1]); IN THIS
    STRATEGY THE PROCESS WILL SWITCH TO COMPLETE PIVOTING IF PARTIAL
    PIVOTING MIGHT NOT YIELD STABLE RESULTS; SO IN GSSELM THE
    EFFICIENCY OF PARTIAL PIVOTING IS COMBINED WITH THE STABILITY OF
    COMPLETE PIVOTING;
    SINCE, IN EXCEPTIONAL CASES, PARTIAL PIVOTING MAY YIELD USELESS
    RESULTS, EVEN FOR WELL-CONDITIONED MATRICES, THE USER IS ADVISED TO
    USE GSSELM; HOWEVER, IF THE NUMBER OF VARIABLES IS SMALL RELATIVE
    TO THE NUMBER OF BINARY DIGITS IN THE MANTISSA (48 FOR THE CYBER ),
    THEN DEC MAY ALSO BE USED;

KEYWORDS:

    ABSMAXMAT   = CP31069.

REQUIRED CENTRAL MEMORY: NO EXTRA ARRAYS ARE DECLARED.

RUNNING TIME: PROPORTIONAL TO N ** 3.

METHOD AND PERFORMANCE:
    THE PROCESS OF GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION IS PERFORMED IN AT MOST N STEPS
    , WHERE N DENOTES THE ORDER OF THE MATRIX; PARTIAL PIVOTING WILL BE
    USED AS LONG AS THE CALCULATED UPPER BOUND FOR THE GROWTH ([2],
    [1]), IS LESS THAN A CRITICAL VALUE THAT EQUALS AUX[4] * N TIMES
    THE MODULUS OF AN ELEMENT WHICH IS OF MAXIMUM ABSOLUTE VALUE FOR
    THE GIVEN MATRIX;
    IN THE PARTIAL PIVOTING STRATEGY, THAT ELEMENT IS CHOSEN AS
    PIVOT IN THE K-TH STEP, WHOSE ABSOLUTE VALUE IS MAXIMAL
    FOR THE K-TH COLUMN OF THE LOWER-TRIANGULAR MATRIX L; HOWEVER, IF
    THE UPPER BOUND FOR THE GROWTH EXCEEDS THIS CRITICAL VALUE IN THE
    K-TH STEP, THEN A PIVOT IS SELECTED IN THE J-TH STEP (J = K,..., N)
    , IN SUCH A WAY, THAT ITS ABSOLUTE VALUE IS MAXIMAL FOR THE
    REMAINING SUBMATRIX OF ORDER N - K + 1 (COMPLETE PIVOTING);
    SINCE  IN PRACTICE,  IF WE CHOOSE  AUX[4] PROPERLY, THE UPPER BOUND
    FOR THE GROWTH RARELY EXCEEDS  THIS CRITICAL VALUE  ([2], [4]),  WE
    WILL  USUALLY  TAKE  ADVANTAGE OF THE GREATER SPEED OF PARTIAL
    PIVOTING (ORDER N - K + 1 IN THE K-TH STEP), WHILE IN A FEW
    DOUBTFUL CASES NUMERICAL DIFFICULTIES WILL BE RECOGNIZED AND THE
    PROCESS WILL SWITCH TO COMPLETE PIVOTING (ORDER
    (N - K + 1) ** 2 IN THE K-TH STEP);
    USING GSSELM,THE UPPER BOUND FOR THE RELATIVE ERROR IN THE SOLUTION
    OF A LINEAR SYSTEM ([4], [5]), WILL BE AT MOST AUX[4] * N TIMES THE
    UPPER BOUND USING GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION WITH COMPLETE PIVOTING ONLY;
    USUALLY, HOWEVER, THIS WILL BE A CRUDE OVERESTIMATE;
    THE CHOICE AUX[4] &lt; 1 / N WILL RESULT IN COMPLETE PIVOTING ONLY
    , WHILE  PARTIAL PIVOTING WILL BE USED IN EVERY STEP IF WE CHOOSE
    AUX[4] &gt; (2 ** (N - 1)) / N; USUALLY, AUX[4] = 8 WILL GIVE
    GOOD RESULTS ([2], [1]);
    THE PROCESS WILL ALSO SWITCH TO COMPLETE PIVOTING IF THE MODULUS OF
    THE PIVOT OBTAINED WITH PARTIAL PIVOTING IS LESS THAN A CERTAIN
    TOLERANCE, WHICH EQUALS THE GIVEN RELATIVE TOLERANCE AUX[2] TIMES
    THE MODULUS OF AN ELEMENT WHICH IS OF MAXIMUM ABSOLUTE VALUE FOR
    THE GIVEN MATRIX; IF ALL ELEMENTS IN THE REMAINING SUBMATRIX ARE
    SMALLER IN ABSOLUTE VALUE THAN THIS TOLERANCE THEN THE PROCESS IS
    BROKEN OFF AND THE PREVIOUS STEPNUMBER IS DELIVERED IN AUX[3];
    IN  CONTRAST  WITH  THE  METHOD  USED  IN  DEC  (THIS SECTION),  NO
    EQUILIBRATING IS DONE  IN THIS PIVOTING STRATEGY;  THE USER HIMSELF
    HAS TO TAKE CARE FOR A REASONABLE SCALING OF THE MATRIX ELEMENTS.

            AUX[5]: THE  MODULUS  OF  AN  ELEMENT,  WHICH IS OF MAXIMUM
                    ABSOLUTE VALUE FOR THE MATRIX WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN
                    IN ARRAY A;

            AUX[9]: IF AUX[3] = N, THEN AUX[9] WIL EQUAL  THE 1-NORM OF

            EXIT:THE PIVOTAL COLUMN INDICES.

PROCEDURES USED:

    GSSELM      = CP34231,
    ONENRMINV   = CP34240.

REQUIRED CENTRAL MEMORY: NO EXTRA ARRAYS ARE DECLARED.

RUNNING TIME: PROPORTIONAL TO N ** 3.

METHOD AND PERFORMANCE:

    GSSNRI  USES  GSSELM  (THIS  SECTION)  TO  PERFORM  THE  TRIANGULAR
    DECOMPOSITION OF THE MATRIX GIVEN IN ARRAY  A  AND  ONENRMINV (THIS
    SECTION)  TO  CALCULATE  THE  1-NORM  OF  THE  INVERSE  MATRIX;  IF
    AUX[3] &lt; N,  THEN THE EFFECT OF  GSSNRI  IS  MERELY THAT OF  GSSELM
    (THIS SECTION).

EXAMPLE OF USE: SEE GSSITISOLERB (SECTION 3.1.1.1.1.1.5).
