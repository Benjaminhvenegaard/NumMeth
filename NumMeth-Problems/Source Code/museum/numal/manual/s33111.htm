BRIEF DESCRIPTION:
    THIS SECTION  CONTAINS FOUR PROCEDURES FOR CALCULATING  EIGENVALUES
    OR EIGENVECTORS OF A SYMMETRIC TRIDIAGONAL MATRIX.
    VALSYMTRI  CALCULATES  ALL, OR  SOME  CONSECUTIVE, EIGENVALUES OF A
    SYMMETRIC TRIDIAGONAL MATRIX BY MEANS OF LINEAR INTERPOLATION USING
    A STURM SEQUENCE;
    VECSYMTRI  CALCULATES  THE  CORRESPONDING  EIGENVECTORS BY MEANS OF
    INVERSE ITERATION.
    QRIVALSYMTRI  CALCULATES ALL EIGENVALUES OF A SYMMETRIC TRIDIAGONAL
    MATRIX BY MEANS OF QR ITERATION;
    QRISYMTRI CALCULATES THE EIGENVECTORS AS WELL.
    WHEN ALL EIGENVALUES HAVE TO BE CALCULATED, QRIVALSYMTRI IS
    PREFERABLE WITH RESPECT TO THE RUNNING TIME; WHEN THE EIGENVECTORS
    ALSO HAVE TO BE CALCULATED, INVERSE ITERATION IS PREFERABLE.

KEYWORDS:
    EIGENVALUES,
    EIGENVECTORS,
    TRIDIAGONAL MATRIX,
    STURM-SEQUENCE,
    INVERSE ITERATION,
    QR ITERATION.

                    MATRIX;

    EM:     &lt;ARRAY IDENTIFIER&gt;;
            "ARRAY" EM[0:3];
            ENTRY:  EM[0], THE MACHINE PRECISION,
                    EM[1], AN UPPERBOUND FOR THE MODULI OF THE
                           EIGENVALUES OF THE GIVEN MATRIX,

PROCEDURES USED:
    ZEROIN  =       CP34150.

RUNNING TIME:
    DEPENDS STRONGLY ON THE DISTANCE OF SUCCESSIVE EIGENVALUES.

LANGUAGE:   ALGOL 60.

METHOD AND PERFORMANCE:
    LET T DENOTE THE GIVEN SYMMETRIC  TRIDIAGONAL MATRIX OF ORDER N AND
    I THE IDENTITY MATRIX.  THE  EIGENVALUES OF T ARE THE ZEROES OF THE
    N-TH DEGREE POLYNOMIAL P(N,X) = DET(T - X*I).  INSTEAD OF SEARCHING
    FOR THE ZEROES OF  P(N,X)  WE  LOOK  FOR THE ZEROES OF THE FUNCTION
    F(N,X) =  P(N,X) /  P(N-1,X).   MAINTAINING   A  LOWER   BOUND  FOR
    ABS(P(N-1,X)) WE DO AVOID  OVERFLOW OF THE REAL NUMBER  CAPACITY IN
    THE  COMPUTATION  OF  F(N,X).  THIS  FUNCTION  CAN BE CALCULATED AS
    FOLLOWS:

            F(1,X) = D[1] - X,
            F(K,X) = D[K] - X - BB[K-1] /
            ("IF" ABS(F(K-1,X)) &gt; MACHTOL "THEN" F(K-1,X)
            "ELSE" "IF" F(K-1,X) &lt;= 0 "THEN" -MACHTOL
            "ELSE" MACHTOL),  K = 2, . . . ,N,
    WHERE MACHTOL EQUALS EM[0] * EM[1].
    USING THE STURM SEQUENCE  PROPERTY OF (F(K,X)), K=1,2,...,N, WE CAN
    LOCATE  THE DESIRED  EIGENVALUES  BY  MEANS OF THE PROCEDURE ZEROIN
    (SECTION  5.1.1.1). FOR FURTHER DETAILS SEE REF[1], REF[2].

                    EM[7], THE MAXIMUM  EUCLIDEAN NORM OF THE RESIDUES,

                           FOR THE CALCULATION OF SOME EIGENVECTOR (SEE
                           METHOD AND PERFORMANCE).

PROCEDURES USED:
    VECVEC   =      CP34010,
    TAMVEC   =      CP34012,
    ELMVECCOL=      CP34021.

REQUIRED CENTRAL MEMORY:
    EXECUTION FIELD LENGTH: FIVE  AUXILIARY ONE-DIMENSIONAL REAL ARRAYS
                    AND ONE BOOLEAN ARRAY, ALL OF LENGTH N, ARE USED.

RUNNING TIME: THE PROCESS IS OF ORDER N FOR EACH EIGENVECTOR.

LANGUAGE:   ALGOL 60.

METHOD AND PERFORMANCE:
    AN EIGENVECTOR OF A SYMMETRIC  TRIDIAGONAL  MATRIX T, CORRESPONDING
    TO  AN  EIGENVALUE  LAMBDA,  IS  CALCULATED  BY  MEANS  OF  INVERSE
    ITERATION;  I.E.  STARTING  FROM  SOME INITIAL VECTOR X, THE LINEAR
    SYSTEM (T - LAMBDA * I)Y = X IS SOLVED ITERATIVELY, THE SOLUTION Y,
    DIVIDED BY ITS EUCLIDEAN NORM REPLACING X EACH TIME.
    IF THE DISTANCE  BETWEEN  SOME  APPROXIMATE  EIGENVALUES IS SMALLER
    THAN MACHTOL (=EM[0] * EM[1]), THEN THEY ARE SLIGHTLY MODIFIED SUCH
    THAT THE DISTANCE  BETWEEN  THEM  EQUALS  MACHTOL. IF THE  DISTANCE
    BETWEEN  SOME  EIGENVALUES  IS  SMALLER THAN THE  ORTHOGONALISATION
    PARAMETER (=EM[4]) TIMES EM[1], THEN IN EACH ITERATION  STEP  GRAM-
    SCHMIDT  ORTHOGONALISATION IS CARRIED OUT, SO THAT THE EIGENVECTORS
    OBTAINED ARE ORTHOGONAL  WITHIN  WORKING  PRECISION. THE  ITERATION
    ENDS AS SOON AS EITHER THE EUCLIDEAN NORM OF THE RESIDUE IS SMALLER
    THAN EM[1] * EM[6], OR THE MAXIMUM  ALLOWED  NUMBER  OF  ITERATIONS
    (=EM[8])  HAS BEEN PERFORMED. IN THE LATTER CASE EM[9]:= EM[8] + 1.
    IF N1 &gt; 1, THEN  VECSYMTRI  SHOULD BE PRECEDED BY ONE OR MORE CALLS
    OF VECSYMTRI PRODUCING A NUMBER  OF  EIGENVECTORS  CORRESPONDING TO
    THE  PRECEDING  EIGENVALUES.  MOREOVER  ONE  MUST  GIVE  EM[5],  AS
    PRODUCED  BY  THE  LAST  CALL  OF  VECSYMTRI;  THE  K-TH  TO  N2-TH
    EIGENVALUES, WHERE K = N1 - EM[5], MUST BE GIVEN IN ARRAY VAL[K:N2]
    IN  MONOTONICALLY  NONINCREASING   ORDER  (THE  K-TH  TO  (N1-1)-TH
    EIGENVALUES  BEING  NEEDED  FOR THE MODIFYING MENTIONED ABOVE), AND
    THE  CORRESPONDING  EIGENVECTORS  UP  TO  THE  (N1-1)-TH (WHICH ARE
    NEEDED FOR THE GRAM-SCHMIDT ORTHOGONALISATION) IN THE CORRESPONDING
    COLUMNS OF ARRAY VEC[1:N,K:N2].
    THE  TOLERANCES   SHOULD   SATISFY:  EM[0] ( &lt; EM[2]) &lt;  EM[6]  AND
    EM[4]  &gt;=  EM[0] / EM[6]. FOR FURTHER DETAILS SEE REF[1].

            QRIVALSYMTRI:= THE NUMBER OF  EIGENVALUES  NOT  CALCULATED.

PROCEDURES USED:    NONE.

RUNNING TIME:       THE PROCESS IS OF ORDER N SQUARED.

LANGUAGE:   ALGOL 60.

METHOD AND PERFORMANCE:
    IN QRIVALSYMTRI THE EIGENVALUES OF A SYMMETRIC TRIDIAGONAL MATRIX
    ARE CALCULATED BY MEANS OF QR-ITERATION. FOR THIS PROCEDURE WE USED
    ESSENTIALLY THE SQUARE-ROOT-FREE VERSION OF THE QR ALGORITHM DUE TO
    REINSCH[3].
    IN ADDITION TO THE RELATIVE ERROR, WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE BOUNDED
    BY EM[1] * EM[2] (I.E. MATRIX NORM TIMES RELATIVE TOLERANCE), THE
    CALCULATED EIGENVALUES HAVE AN ABSOLUTE ERROR WHICH IS BOUNDED BY
    BY EM[0] * EM[1] (I.E. MACHINE PRECISION TIMES MATRIX NORM).
    IN PARTICULAR, WHEN SOME EIGENVALUES ARE VERY SMALL COMPARED TO THE
    MATRIX NORM, THE ACCURACY OF THE CALCULATED EIGENVALUES CAN BE
    INCREASED BY GIVING EM[0] A (POSITIVE) VALUE WHICH IS LESS THAN
    THE MACHINE PRECISION.
    A PARTICULAR CHOICE OF EM[0] IS HARMLESS FOR THE PROCEDURE
    PROVIDED THAT FOR EACH I THE CALCULATION OF BB[I] / EM[0] ** 2
    CAUSES NO OVERFLOW AND THE CALCULATION OF (EM[0] * EM[1]) ** 2
    CAUSES NO UNDERFLOW.
    ONE SHOULD NOTICE THAT THE NUMBER OF QR ITERATIONS INCREASES BY A
    SMALLER CHOICE OF EM[0].

PROCEDURES USED:
    ROTCOL  =       CP34040.

RUNNING TIME:       THE PROCESS IS OF ORDER N CUBED.

LANGUAGE:   ALGOL 60.

METHOD AND PERFORMANCE:
    IN  QRISYMTRI  THE  EIGENVALUES  AND  EIGENVECTORS  OF A  SYMMETRIC
    TRIDIAGONAL MATRIX ARE COMPUTED SIMULTANEOUSLY.
    IN MOST  APPLICATIONS  QRISYMTRI  IS  USED  IN THE  COMPUTATION  OF
    EIGENVALUES AND -VECTORS OF A GENERAL  SYMMETRIC MATRIX (SEE QRISYM
    SECTION 3.3.1.1.2); IN THAT CASE ARRAY A IS INITIALLY GIVEN THE
    VALUE OF THE TRANSFORMING MATRIX (TFMPREVEC SECTION 3.2.1.2.1.1).
    FOR THE  COMPUTATION OF EIGENVALUES AND EIGENVECTORS OF A SYMMETRIC
    TRIDIAGONAL  MATRIX,  ARRAY A HAS TO BE INITIALIZED TO THE IDENTITY
    MATRIX.  THE  AVERAGE  NUMBER OF ITERATIONS IS ABOUT 3N.  WHEN  THE
    PROCESS IS COMPLETED  WITHIN  EM[4] ITERATIONS, THEN QRISYMTRI:= 0;
    OTHERWISE QRISYMTRI:= THE NUMBER, K, OF EIGENVALUES NOT CALCULATED,
    EM[5]:= EM[4] + 1  AND  ONLY THE LAST  N - K  ELEMENTS OF D AND THE
    LAST  N - K  COLUMNS OF A ARE APPROXIMATE  EIGENVALUES AND -VECTORS
    RESPECTIVELY, OF THE ORIGINAL MATRIX.
