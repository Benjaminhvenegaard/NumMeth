    POLYNOMIAL (I.E. J-TH DERIVATIVE/(J FACTORIAL),J=0,1,...,K&lt;=DEGREE;

    TAYPOL EVALUATES X**J*(J-TH DERIVATIVE)/(J FACTORIAL),
    J=0,1,...,K&lt;=DEGREE.

KEYWORDS:

SUBSECTION: POL.

CALLING SEQUENCE:

    THE HEADING OF THE PROCEDURE READS:
    "REAL""PROCEDURE" POL(N,X,A);
    "VALUE"N,X;"INTEGER"N;"REAL"X;"ARRAY"A;
    "CODE" 31040;

    POL:=A[0]+A[1]*X+...+A[N]*X**N;

    THE MEANING OF THE FORMAL PARAMETERS IS:

         ENTRY: THE DEGREE OF THE POLYNOMIAL;
    X:   &lt;ARITHMETIC EXPRESSION&gt;;

    A:   &lt;ARRAY IDENTIFIER&gt;;
         "ARRAY"A[0:N];
         ENTRY: THE COEFFICIENTS OF THE POLYNOMIAL
                A[0]+A[1]*X+...+A[N]*X**N.

PROCEDURES USED: NONE.

RUNNING TIME: PROPORTIONAL TO N
              (N MULTIPLICATIONS AND ADDITIONS).

METHOD AND PERFORMANCE:
    THE METHOD USED FOR EVALUATION IS HORNER'S RULE (SYNTHETIC
    DIVISION). THE ERROR GROWTH IS GIVEN BY A LINEAR FUNCTION OF THE
    DEGREE OF THE POLYNOMIAL (SEE VAN DER LAAN, STOER(1972) P. 29 (EX.
    11) OR WILKINSON(1963) P. 36,37).

PROCEDURES USED: NONE.

RUNNING TIME: THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONS IS (K+1)*(N-K/2) AND
              THE NUMBER OF MULTIPLICATIONS IS 2 * N.

LANGUAGE: ALGOL 60.

METHOD AND PERFORMANCE:
    THE METHOD OF EVALUATION IS GIVEN BY TRAUB AND SHAW(1972,1974).
    LET X**J*(J-TH DERIVATIVE OF THE POLYNOMIAL)/(J FACTORIAL)=
    (J OVER J)*A[J]*X**J+(J+1 OVER J)*A[J+1]*X**(J+1)+...+(N OVER J)*
    A[N]*X**N,THEN THE J-TH DERIVATIVE (UP TO A FACTOR) CAN BE OBTAINED
    FROM THE BINOMIAL COEFFICIENTS FOLLOWED BY EVALUATION OF THE ABOVE
    INPRODUCT. THE SHAW AND TRAUB ALGORITHM PERFORMS THE BUILDING UP OF
    THE BINOMIAL COEFFICIENTS IMPLICITLY.
    WE HAVE NOT IMPLEMENTED THE MORE SOPHISTICATED ALGORITHM, BASED
    ON DIVISORS OF N+1, BECAUSE OF THE MORE COMPLEX APPEARANCE
    OF  THE IMPLEMENTATION AND BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY IN CHOSING
    THE MOST EFFICIENT DIVISOR. OUR (RESTRICTED) IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
    ONE-PARAMETER FAMILY OF ALGORITHMS PRESERVES THE LINEAR NUMBER OF
    MULTIPLICATIONS (2*N (NORDERPOL, TAYPOL) AND 3*N (DERPOL)).
    THE ABSOLUTE ERROR IS OF ORDER MAX((N OVER N)*A[N]*X**(N-K),...,
    (N OVER K)*A[K]), FOR THE K-TH NORMALIZED DERIVATIVE (SEE VAN DER
    LAAN OR WOZNIAKOWSKI).
