BRIEF DESCRIPTION:

    THIS SECTION CONTAINS TWO PROCEDURES
    FOR  SOLVING  A  SYSTEM  OF  LINEAR  EQUATIONS   WITH  A  SYMMETRIC
    TRIDIAGONAL  MATRIX;
    SOLSYMTRI  CALCULATES  A  SOLUTION   IF  THE
    TRIANGULARLY DECOMPOSED FORM,  AS DELIVERED BY  DECSYMTRI  (SECTION
    3.1.2.1.1.2.2.1),  IS GIVEN;
    DECSOLSYMTRI  PERFORMS THE TRIANGULAR
    DECOMPOSITION  AS WELL AS  THE  FORWARD  AND  BACK SUBSTITUTION  TO
    CALCULATE THE SOLUTION  OF THE GIVEN LINEAR SYSTEM.

KEYWORDS:

    ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS,
    LINEAR SYSTEMS,
    SYMMETRIC TRIDIAGONAL MATRIX,
    FORWARD AND BACK SUBSTITUTION.

CALLING SEQUENCE:

    THE HEADING OF THIS PROCEDURE IS:
    "PROCEDURE" SOLSYMTRI(DIAG, CO, N, B);
    "VALUE" N; "INTEGER" N; "ARRAY" DIAG, CO, B; "CODE" 34421;

    THE MEANING OF THE FORMAL PARAMETERS IS:
    DIAG:   &lt;ARRAY IDENTIFIER&gt;;
            "ARRAY" DIAG[1:N];
            ENTRY:  THE  DIAGONAL  MATRIX,  AS
            DELIVERED BY DECSYMTRI (SECTION 3.1.2.1.1.2.2.1);
    CO:     &lt;ARRAY IDENTIFIER&gt;;
            "ARRAY" CO[1: N - 1];
            ENTRY:  THE CODIAGONAL OF THE UNIT
            UPPER-BIDIAGONAL MATRIX AS DELIVERED BY DECSYMTRI;
    N:      &lt;ARITHMETIC EXPRESSION&gt;;
            THE ORDER OF THE MATRIX;
    B:      &lt;ARRAY IDENTIFIER&gt;;
            "ARRAY" B[1:N];
            ENTRY:  THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE LINEAR SYSTEM;
            EXIT:   THE CALCULATED SOLUTION OF THE LINEAR SYSTEM.

PROCEDURES USED: NONE.

METHOD AND PERFORMANCE:

    SOLSYMTRI  CALCULATES  THE  SOLUTION  OF  A  LINEAR  SYSTEM  WITH A
    SYMMETRIC TRIDIAGONAL MATRIX, WITH FORWARD  AND  BACK SUBSTITUTION;
    THE TRIANGULARLY  DECOMPOSED  FORM  OF  THE MATRIX,  AS PRODUCED BY
    DECSYMTRI (SECTION  3.1.2.1.1.2.2.1), SHOULD BE GIVEN;  ONE CALL OF
    DECSYMTRI FOLLOWED BY SEVERAL CALLS OF  SOLSYMTRI  MAY BE  USED  TO
    SOLVE SEVERAL LINEAR SYSTEMS  HAVING THE SAME SYMMETRIC TRIDIAGONAL
    MATRIX, BUT DIFFERENT RIGHT HAND SIDES.

EXAMPLE OF USE: SEE DECSOLSYMTRI (THIS SECTION).

CALLING SEQUENCE:

    THE HEADING OF THIS PROCEDURE IS:
    "PROCEDURE" DECSOLSYMTRI(DIAG, CO, N, AUX, B);
    "VALUE" N; "INTEGER" N; "ARRAY" DIAG, CO, AUX, B; "CODE" 34422;

    THE MEANING OF THE FORMAL PARAMETERS IS:
    DIAG:   &lt;ARRAY IDENTIFIER&gt;;
            "ARRAY" DIAG[1: N];
            ENTRY:  THE DIAGONAL OF THE GIVEN MATRIX T, SAY;
            EXIT:   SUPPOSE U DENOTES THE UNIT UPPER-BIDIAGONAL MATRIX,
                    SUCH THAT  U'DU = T   FOR SOME  DIAGONAL MATRIX  D,
                    WHERE U' DENOTES THE TRANSPOSED MATRIX; THEN D[I,I]
                    WILL BE DELIVERED IN DIAG[I], I = 1, ..., AUX[3];
    CO:     &lt;ARRAY IDENTIFIER&gt;;
            "ARRAY" CO[1: N - 1];
            ENTRY:  THE CODIAGONAL OF T; T[I, I + 1] SHOULD BE GIVEN IN
                    CO[I], I = 1, ..., N - 1;
            EXIT:   U[I, I + 1] WILL BE DELIVERED IN CO[I], I = 1, ...,
                    AUX[3] - 1;
    N:      &lt;ARITHMETIC EXPRESSION&gt;;
            THE ORDER OF THE MATRIX;
    AUX:    &lt;ARRAY IDENTIFIER&gt;;
            "ARRAY" AUX[2:5];
            ENTRY:
            AUX[2]: A RELATIVE TOLERANCE;  A REASONABLE CHOICE FOR THIS
                    VALUE IS AN ESTIMATE OF  THE RELATIVE PRECISION  OF
                    THE  MATRIX ELEMENTS,  HOWEVER, IT  SHOULD  NOT  BE
                    CHOSEN SMALLER THAN THE MACHINE PRECISION;
            EXIT:
            AUX[3]: THE NUMBER OF ELIMINATION STEPS PERFORMED;
            AUX[5]: IF AUX[3] = N, THEN AUX[5] WILL EQUAL THE INFINITY-
                    NORM OF THE MATRIX,  ELSE  AUX[5]  IS SET  EQUAL TO
                    THE  VALUE  OF  THAT  ELEMENT   WHICH   CAUSES  THE
                    BREAKDOWN OF THE DECOMPOSITION;
    B:      &lt;ARRAY IDENTIFIER&gt;;
            "ARRAY" B[1:N];
            ENTRY:  THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE LINEAR SYSTEM;
            EXIT:   IF  AUX[3] = N  THEN  THE  SOLUTION  OF  THE LINEAR
                    SYSTEM  IS  OVERWRITTEN  ON   B,  ELSE   B  REMAINS
                    UNALTERED.

PROCEDURES USED:

    DECSYMTRI = CP34420,
    SOLSYMTRI = CP34421.

METHOD AND PERFORMANCE:

    DECSOLSYMTRI  CALCULATES  THE SOLUTION  OF  A LINEAR SYSTEM  WITH A
    SYMMETRIC TRIDIAGONAL MATRIX;  THE TRIANGULAR DECOMPOSITION IS DONE
    BY CALLING DECSYMTRI (SECTION 3.1.2.1.1.2.2.1)  AND THE FORWARD AND
    BACK SUBSTITUTION BY CALLING SOLSYMTRI (THIS SECTION); IF AUX[3]&lt;N,
    THEN THE EFFECT OF DECSOLSYMTRI IS MERELY THAT OF DECSYMTRI.

EXAMPLE OF USE:

    LET T BE A SYMMETRIC TRIDIAGONAL MATRIX OF ORDER 100  WITH DIAGONAL
    ELEMENTS I (I = 1, ..., 100) AND CODIAGONAL ELEMENTS I * 2  (I = 1,
    ..., 99); LET THE RIGHT HAND SIDE  B  BE GIVEN BY THE SECOND COLUMN
    OF T; THEN THE SOLUTION OF THE LINEAR SYSTEM TX = B IS GIVEN BY THE
    SECOND UNIT VECTOR;  BY  THE FOLLOWING PROGRAM  WE  MAY SOLVE  THIS
    SYSTEM AND PRINT THE ERROR IN THE CALCULATED SOLUTION.

    "BEGIN"
        "INTEGER" I; "ARRAY" D, CO, B[1:100], AUX[2:5];
        "FOR" I:= 1 "STEP" 1 "UNTIL" 100 "DO"
        "BEGIN" D[I]:= I; CO[I]:= I * 2; B[I]:= 0 "END";
        B[1]:= B[2]:= 2; B[3]:= 4;
        AUX[2]:= "-14;
        DECSOLSYMTRI(D, CO, 100, AUX, B);
        B[2]:= B[2] - 1;
        OUTPUT(71, "("/,"("    AUX[3] AND AUX[5]:")",2(/4B,N)")",
        AUX[3], AUX[5]);
        OUTPUT(71, "("//,"("    ERROR IN THE SOLUTION:")",N,/")",
        SQRT(VECVEC(1, 100, 0, B, B)))
    "END"

    RESULTS:

    AUX[3] AND AUX[5]:
    +1.0000000000000"+002
    +4.9300000000000"+002

    ERROR IN THE SOLUTION:+0.0000000000000"+000
