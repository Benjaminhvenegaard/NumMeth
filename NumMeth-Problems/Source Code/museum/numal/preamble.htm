<H3><A NAME="history">The history of NUMAL</A></H3>
In the years 1973 - 1979 a systematically organized library of
ALGOL 60 procedures in Numerical Mathematics was assembled, called NUMAL.
The work of implementing numerical algorithms and documenting the
implementations was directed by P.W. Hemker of the
<STRONG>Mathematisch Centrum</STRONG> at Amsterdam (Mathematical Centre - MC)
and carried out by a large group of (numerical) mathematicians
from the MC and the Dutch Universities of Amsterdam and Groningen.

<P>In the sixties the MC was an influential center regarding the
scientific use of early-day computers. It had played a keyrole in
the construction of computers in The Netherlands and taken part in the
design of ALGOL 60. The MC was providing computer services to the academic
world: its Electrologica X1 and X8 computers were available for testing
and running programs written in ALGOL 60.
When large computer centers were created for the Dutch universities,
the availability of ALGOL 60 compilers was a logical requirement, and it
was found equally logical that several <A HREF="#earlier">early</A>
collections of ALGOL 60 procedures for subareas of numerical mathematics
would be united (and extended) to a complete and coherent mathematical
software library.

<P>One may suspect it was also hoped that with the obvious
advantages of ALGOL 60 for developing new software
the library would achieve a prominent place in the scientific world
among its equivalents, such as were developed in Fortran by IMSL and NAG.

<P>What resulted was, first, a systematic classification of all possible
branches of numerical mathematics, including sectors for auxiliary
procedures like manipulating vectors and matrices which fitted with the
design characteristic of modularity and would allow a certain level of a
common programming style. Next, a library of ALGOL 60 procedures was created
starting with the earlier collections: procedures were
incorporated when sufficiently supplemented with uniform documentation,
and the growing library was further extended with the results of ongoing
research. See [Hemker, 1977] for background of this library construction
effort.

<P>But ALGOL 60 did not become very popular and with the decreasing
interest in ALGOL 60 the justification for continuing development and
maintenance of NUMAL disappeared, together with the support for the MC
to carry out most of the work. When this became apparent, the MC
terminated the project (in 1980) with the publication in book form
(MC Syllabus 47) of the whole manual together with the systematic
classification and a KWIC index:
<BLOCKQUOTE>P.W. Hemker (ed.): <EM>NUMAL, Numerical
procedures in ALGOL 60</EM>, MC Amsterdam, 1981, MC Syllabus 47.1 - 47.7.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>One year later, J. Kok and D.T. Winter carried out the fifth and last
revision of the NUMAL library and manual, to make NUMAL sources satisfy the
more severe language requirements of a new ALGOL 60 compiler; at the
same time they corrected typos and reorganized the on-line manual.

<P>What is made accessible here are the following original, unchanged
texts (please note that much additional information in these texts
is not valid any more, such as about tapes or even the

In the early days a couple of procedure collections were produced at
the MC such as the Zonneveld collection for (systems of) ODEs and the
Dekker, resp. Dekker &amp; Hoffmann collections for linear algebra problems
(see <A HREF="#refs">references</A>),
and similar sets for double precision and complex numbers.
An older collection (AP 200) contained a set of ALGOL 60
procedures for use on the X1 machine, e.g. for zero finding (real and
complex), elliptic integrals and quadrature. Apart from these sets the MC
had also available collections of statistical and plotting routines in
ALGOL 60.

<P>Other, international sources were Collected Algorithms from the Comm.ACM,
Wilkinson &amp; Reinsch, and the journals BIT and Numerische Mathematik.
And finally, the procedure <EM>euler</EM> for summing an alternating
infinite series had already been published in the defining Report on ALGOL 60.

<H3><A NAME="coverage"> Fields covered </A></H3>
The areas for which procedures were present include: 
system calls, elementary and special functions,
vector and matrix manipulation including double precision and
complex arithmetic, long integer arithmetic, fourier series,
linear systems of general and special forms, including overdetermined
systems, singular value decomposition, eigenvalue / eigenvector problems,
zero finding, nonlinear systems, quadrature, approximation, summation of
series, ordinary and partial differential equations (initial and boundary
value problems). Not treated were problems belonging to statistics or
operation control, or other computer science methods although a sorting
procedure could be found.

<H3><A NAME="focus"> Focus </A></H3>
The library was developed, tested and used mainly on successive CDC
machines available to the Dutch academic world, under successive
versions (version 3 to 5) of their ALGOL compilers.  This is still reflected
in the employment of the <STRONG>code</STRONG> conventions
for calling pre-compiled library procedures.
Computer architecture properties concerning floating-point precision
are less conspicuous as the prevailing programming style was that for
iterative methods the user had to provide tolerances through procedure
parameters (hence, only the defaults and examples showed the CDC
preference).

<H3><A NAME="today"> Status today </A></H3>
As mentioned before, development ended around 1980, and maintenance
stopped some years later when the ALGOL services at the Amsterdam
Academic Computer Center (SARA) ended. Subsets of the library had
a prolonged, but less well-known life by their conversion (by MC) for
subset libraries in Pascal, Algol 68 and Ada. Independently,
H.T. Lau supervised a mainly automatic conversion of the whole
NUMAL library to Fortran and, more recently, to C.
