  The history of NUMAL
  
   In the years 1973 - 1979 a systematically organized library of ALGOL
   60 procedures in Numerical Mathematics was assembled, called NUMAL.
   The work of implementing numerical algorithms and documenting the
   implementations was directed by P.W. Hemker of the Mathematisch
   Centrum at Amsterdam (Mathematical Centre - MC) and carried out by a
   large group of (numerical) mathematicians from the MC and the Dutch
   Universities of Amsterdam and Groningen.
   
   In the sixties the MC was an influential center regarding the
   scientific use of early-day computers. It had played a keyrole in the
   construction of computers in The Netherlands and taken part in the
   design of ALGOL 60. The MC was providing computer services to the
   academic world: its Electrologica X1 and X8 computers were available
   for testing and running programs written in ALGOL 60. When large
   computer centers were created for the Dutch universities, the
   availability of ALGOL 60 compilers was a logical requirement, and it
   was found equally logical that several early collections of ALGOL 60
   procedures for subareas of numerical mathematics would be united (and
   extended) to a complete and coherent mathematical software library.
   
   One may suspect it was also hoped that with the obvious advantages of
   ALGOL 60 for developing new software the library would achieve a
   prominent place in the scientific world among its equivalents, such as
   were developed in Fortran by IMSL and NAG.
   
   What resulted was, first, a systematic classification of all possible
   branches of numerical mathematics, including sectors for auxiliary
   procedures like manipulating vectors and matrices which fitted with
   the design characteristic of modularity and would allow a certain
   level of a common programming style. Next, a library of ALGOL 60
   procedures was created starting with the earlier collections:
   procedures were incorporated when sufficiently supplemented with
   uniform documentation, and the growing library was further extended
   with the results of ongoing research. See [Hemker, 1977] for
   background of this library construction effort.
   
   But ALGOL 60 did not become very popular and with the decreasing
   interest in ALGOL 60 the justification for continuing development and
   maintenance of NUMAL disappeared, together with the support for the MC
   to carry out most of the work. When this became apparent, the MC
   terminated the project (in 1980) with the publication in book form (MC
   Syllabus 47) of the whole manual together with the systematic
   classification and a KWIC index:
   
     P.W. Hemker (ed.): NUMAL, Numerical procedures in ALGOL 60, MC
     Amsterdam, 1981, MC Syllabus 47.1 - 47.7.
     
   
   
   One year later, J. Kok and D.T. Winter carried out the fifth and last
   revision of the NUMAL library and manual, to make NUMAL sources
   satisfy the more severe language requirements of a new ALGOL 60
   compiler; at the same time they corrected typos and reorganized the
   on-line manual.
   
   What is made accessible here are the following original, unchanged
   texts (please note that much additional information in these texts is
   not valid any more, such as about tapes or even the address of the
   MC):
     * Title page and introduction including acknowledgements, as printed
       in the book version (MC Syllabus 47), the 4-th revision (8 pages)
       (Link)
     * Systematic index (Link)
     * NUMAL manual (final revision), accessible from the systematic
       index
       
  Earlier work 
  
   In the early days a couple of procedure collections were produced at
   the MC such as the Zonneveld collection for (systems of) ODEs and the
   Dekker, resp. Dekker & Hoffmann collections for linear algebra
   problems (see references), and similar sets for double precision and
   complex numbers. An older collection (AP 200) contained a set of ALGOL
   60 procedures for use on the X1 machine, e.g. for zero finding (real
   and complex), elliptic integrals and quadrature. Apart from these sets
   the MC had also available collections of statistical and plotting
   routines in ALGOL 60.
   
   Other, international sources were Collected Algorithms from the
   Comm.ACM, Wilkinson & Reinsch, and the journals BIT and Numerische
   Mathematik. And finally, the procedure euler for summing an
   alternating infinite series had already been published in the defining
   Report on ALGOL 60.
   
  Fields covered 
  
   The areas for which procedures were present include: system calls,
   elementary and special functions, vector and matrix manipulation
   including double precision and complex arithmetic, long integer
   arithmetic, fourier series, linear systems of general and special
   forms, including overdetermined systems, singular value decomposition,
   eigenvalue / eigenvector problems, zero finding, nonlinear systems,
   quadrature, approximation, summation of series, ordinary and partial
   differential equations (initial and boundary value problems). Not
   treated were problems belonging to statistics or operation control, or
   other computer science methods although a sorting procedure could be
   found.
   
  Focus 
  
   The library was developed, tested and used mainly on successive CDC
   machines available to the Dutch academic world, under successive
   versions (version 3 to 5) of their ALGOL compilers. This is still
   reflected in the employment of the code conventions for calling
   pre-compiled library procedures. Computer architecture properties
   concerning floating-point precision are less conspicuous as the
   prevailing programming style was that for iterative methods the user
   had to provide tolerances through procedure parameters (hence, only
   the defaults and examples showed the CDC preference).
   
  Status today 
  
   As mentioned before, development ended around 1980, and maintenance
   stopped some years later when the ALGOL services at the Amsterdam
   Academic Computer Center (SARA) ended. Subsets of the library had a
   prolonged, but less well-known life by their conversion (by MC) for
   subset libraries in Pascal, Algol 68 and Ada. Independently, H.T. Lau
   supervised a mainly automatic conversion of the whole NUMAL library to
   Fortran and, more recently, to C.
