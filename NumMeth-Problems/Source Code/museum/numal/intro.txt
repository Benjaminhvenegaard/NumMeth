                                 INTRODUCTION
                                       
   At the request of the Academic Computing Centre of Amsterdam (SARA)
   the Mathematical Centre started in 1973 the adaptation of its
   collection of numerical procedures for use with the CD Cyber 70
   system. The resulting numerical library is called "NUMAL" (NUMerical
   procedures in ALgol 60).
   
   The documentation appeared in 1974 in a loose leaf manual. It was
   revised and updated in 1975, 1977 and 1979. In this period the library
   grew to a collection of about 430 routines in all different fields of
   numerical mathematics. Although no attempts have been made to create a
   collection that gives a complete overview of all numerical procedures
   available, most areas of numerical mathematics are covered and most
   programs for which a need was felt have been implemented.
   
   The aim of NUMAL was to provide Algol 60 programmers with a high level
   numerical library which contains a set of validated numerical
   procedures together with supporting documentation.
   
   The library has been constructed in a modular way: Most routines refer
   to and rely on other routines that perform a well-defined sub-task.
   the more experienced user can avail himself of these more elementary
   routines in the same way as the authors of the library do. The novice,
   it is better to use the more comprehensive procedures which perform
   complete mathematical computations.
   
   In 1976 and 1977 the Numerical Mathematics department organized a
   seminar on numerical software. In this seminar the use of some Algol
   procedures in the NUMAL library was explained in detail and their
   algorithmic background was clarified. Also, the numerical libraries
   IMSL (Fortran), NAG (Algol 60 and Fortran) and NUMAL (Algol 60) were
   compared. The proceedings of this seminar appeared (in Dutch) in the
   MC-syllabus series of the Mathematical Centre as:
   

   COLLOQUIUM NUMERIEKE PROGRAMMATUUR, DEEL 1
   J.C.P.BUS  ED., MCS 29.1,
   MATHEMATISCH CENTRUM, AMSTERDAM,1976,

   and

   COLLOQUIUM NUMERIEKE PROGRAMMATUUR, DEEL 2
   H.J.J.TE RIELE  ED., MCS 29.2,
   MATHEMATISCH CENTRUM, AMSTERDAM,1977.

  The Language Algol 60 and the Modular Structure
  
   Two important characteristics of NUMAL are : its modular structure,
   and the consistent use of standard Algol 60 (in the sense of the
   revised report on Algol 60, see ref.).
   
   Input and output routines, not being defined in standard Algol 60,
   have not been used in the library source texts. They only appear in
   the documentation where examples of use of the library routines are
   given.
   
   Since double precision is also not defined in Algol 60, a small number
   of double precision arithmetic routines could not be coded in Algol 60
   and, hence, a few (8) double precision modules were coded in assembly
   language.
   
   Except for this small number of double precision arithmetic routines
   all the source texts are written in Algol 60 and, hence, they are in
   principle independent of the computer/compiler used.
   
   In its practical implementation on the CDC-Cyber system most
   elementary routines in the modular structure of the library (i.e. the
   matrix and vector operations) were re-coded by hand in assembly
   language. This has accelerated the operation of most linear algebra
   routines by a factor 2.5. Thus, one of the major disadvantages of the
   use of Algol 60, the relatively long execution times (which first were
   approximately 4 times longer than for an equivalent Fortran program)
   was circumvented to a large extent. This refinement was possible
   because of the consistent application of the modularity principle.

  Organization of the Library
  
   Each routine in the library is identified by a name and a code number.
   The code number can be used in an Algol 60 program when reference is
   made to a pre-compiled procedure in the object code library. All
   procedures in NUMAL are classified according to subject. The subjects
   are identified by a section number. The manual is ordered by these
   section numbers.
   
   In order to find a particular procedure, there is a systematic index
   in which all procedures (their names and their code numbers) are
   recorded and classified by their section number (i.e. by subject).
   
   For cross referencing there is an index by code number, which has
   references to procedure name and section number, and there is also a
   KWIC index in which keywords and procedure names have been ordered
   alphabetically.
   
  The Status of NUMAL
  
   In 1979 the interest at the Mathematical Centre in the creation of
   general numerical software in Algol 60 decreased and the
   drafting-committee decided to conclude the NUMAL project with the
   publication of a final revision of the library in book form. In its
   present form the library NUMAL can be seen as a description of the
   state-of-the-art of numerical Algol 60 programming at the Mathematical
   Centre at the end of the 1970s. We think that it contains a valuable
   collection of routines in a language that still can describe numerical
   procedures better than many other programming languages currently in
   use.
   
  Imperfections and Responsibility
  
   Although the Numerical Mathematics department of the Mathematical
   Centre assumes the responsibility for imperfections both in programs
   and in documentation, neither the Mathematical Centre nor the
   authors/contributors accept responsibility for the consequences of
   such imperfections. Although much effort has been spent to keep the
   number of errors to a minimum, it is possible that some minor errors
   still remain. Therefore the Numerical Mathematics department will keep
   a list of all errors in the documentation and/or the programs that
   become known after publication and this list will be made available
   upon request.
   
  NUMAL in Fortran
  
   A translation of NUMAL into a Fortran version suitable for use on a
   mini-computor is carried out under the supervision of P. Wynn by H.T.
   Lau in the School of Computer Science, McGill University, Montreal,
   Canada. Further research on the Fortran version is also being carried
   out at IIMAS (Instituto de Investigaciones en Matematicas Applicadas y
   en Systemas), Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.
   
  Origin of the Programs
  
   The major part of the library consists of procedures that have been
   developed at the Mathematical Centre. However, some procedures are
   adapted versions of procedures published in the open literature. In
   particular a number of programs are derived from procedures published
   by A. Bjoerck, R. Bulirsch, J.R. Bunch, G.H. Golub, L. Kaufman, B.
   Lindberg, B.N. Parlett, C. Reinsch and J. Stoer.
