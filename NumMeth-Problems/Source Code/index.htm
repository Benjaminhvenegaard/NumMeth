Welcome to the Numerical Recipes Code disk (ver. 3.02).  Be sure to read
this <a href="license.htm">license and legal information</a> before

constitutes your agreement with the terms listed there.<p>

Code files (".h files") are all in C++
and can be accessed directly in the directory
named "code" at the top level of this disk.  Alternatively, the
following links will let you browse code files by name (and brief
description), by routine identifier, or by section number in the book.

Code from the First and Second Editions of Numerical Recipes
is no longer supported, but is included here for the convenience
of users with legacy code bases.  Note that the code is <b>not</b> compatible
between editions.<p>
